<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>The loyalty of Pocahontas, the patriotism of Molly
Pitcher and Dorothy Quincy, the devoted service of
Clara Barton, the heroism of Ida Lewis, the enthusiasm of
Anna Dickinson, the fine work of Louisa Alcott&mdash;all challenge
the emulation of American girls of to-day. Citizen-soldiers
on a field of service as wide as the world, young America
has at this hour of national crisis its chance to win recognition
for fidelity, for bravery, and for loyal service, with
victory for American ideals as its golden reward, in a world
"made safe for democracy."</p>

<p>My first aim in bringing the lives of these ten American
girls from history to the attention of the girls of to-day
has been to inspire them to like deeds of patriotism and
courage. Second only to that purpose is a desire to make
young Americans realize as they read these true stories of
achievement along such widely varying lines of work, that
history is more thrilling than fiction, and that if they will
turn from these short sketches to the longer biographies
from which the facts of these stories have been taken, they
will find interesting and absorbing reading.</p>

<p>May the book accomplish its twofold object, and so
justify its publication at this time of the testing of all true
Americans.</p>

<h2>TEN AMERICAN GIRLS FROM HISTORY</h2>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>POCAHONTAS: THE INDIAN GIRL OF THE VIRGINIA FOREST</h2>


<p>Sunlight glinting between huge forest trees, and blue
skies over-arching the Indian village of Werewocomoco
on the York River in Virginia, where Powhatan, the mighty
"Werowance," or ruler over thirty tribes, was living.</p>

<p>Through Orapakes and Pamunkey and other forest settlements
a long line of fierce warriors were marching Indian
file, on their way to Werewocomoco, leading a captive white
man to Powhatan for inspection and for sentence. As
the warriors passed into the Indian village, they encountered
crowds of dusky braves and tattooed squaws hurrying
along the wood trails, and when they halted at the central
clearing of the village, the crowd closed in around them to
get a better view of the captive. At the same time there
rose a wild clamor from the rear of the throng as a merry
group of shrieking, shouting girls and boys darted forward,
jostling their way through the crowd.</p>

<p>Their leader was a slender, straight young girl with laughing
eyes such as are seldom seen among Indians, and hair
as black as a crow's wing blown about her cheeks in wild
disorder, while her manner was that of a happy hearty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
forest maiden. This was Matoaka, daughter of the Werowance
Powhatan, and although he had many subjects as
well as twenty sons and eleven daughters, not one was ruled
so despotically as was he himself, by this slender girl with
laughing eyes, for whom his pet name was Pocahontas,
or in free translation, "little romp."</p>

<p>Having established themselves in the front row of the
crowd the girls and boys stood eagerly staring at the prisoner,
for many of them had never seen a white man before, and
as Pocahontas watched, she looked like a forest flower in
her robe of soft deer-skin, with beaded moccasins on her
shapely feet, coral bracelets and anklets vying with the color
in her dark cheeks, while a white plume drooping over
her disordered hair proclaimed her to be the daughter of a
great chief. In her health and happiness she radiated a
charm which made her easily the ruling spirit among her
mates, and compelled the gaze of the captive, whose eyes,
looking about for some friendly face among the savage
throng, fastened on the eager little maiden with a feeling
of relief, for her bright glance showed such interest in the
prisoner and such sympathy with him as was to endear her
to his race in later years.</p>

<p>The long line of braves with their heads and shoulders
gaily painted had wound their slow way through forest,
field, and meadow to bring into the presence of the great
"Werowance" a no less important captive than Captain
John Smith, leader in the English Colony at Jamestown
by reason of his quick wit and stout heart. The settlers
having been threatened with a famine, the brave Captain
had volunteered to go on an expedition among neighboring
Indian villages in search of a supply of corn. The trip
had been full of thrilling adventures for him, and had ended
disastrously in his being taken prisoner by Opechancanough,
the brother of Powhatan. The news of Smith's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
capture having been carried to the great Werowance, he
commanded that the pale-faced <i>Caucarouse</i>, or Captain,
be brought to him for sentence. And that was why the
warriors marched into Werewocomoco, Opechancanough in
the center, with the firearms taken from Captain Smith
and his companions carried before him as trophies. The
prisoner followed, gripped by three stalwart Indians, while
six others acted as flank guards to prevent his escape, and
as they passed into Werewocomoco they were greeted by
yelling savages brandishing weapons and surging forward
to get a better glimpse of the white captive. The procession
halted for a few minutes at the village clearing, then
moved slowly on to Powhatan's "Chief Place of Council,"
a long arbor-like structure where the great Werowance was
waiting to receive Captain Smith.</p>

<p>The crowd of boys and girls followed in the wake of the
warriors until the Council Hall was reached, when they all
dropped back except their leader. Pushing her hair from
her low brow, that she might see more clearly, and walking
with the erectness of a Werowance's daughter, Pocahontas
entered the hall and stood near her father where she could
not only watch the white captive, who appealed strongly
to her fancy, but could also note Powhatan's expression as
he passed judgment on the prisoner.</p>

<p>With inscrutable reserve and majestic dignity the great
ruler bowed as the captive was led before his rustic throne,
where he reclined in a gorgeous robe of raccoon-skins. On
either side of the Council Hall sat rows of dusky men and
women, with their heads and shoulders painted red, some
of the women wearing garments trimmed with the white
down from birds' breasts, while others wore long chains of
white beads about their necks.</p>

<p>It was a picturesque sight for English eyes, and fearful
though he was of foul play, the Captain could not but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
appreciate the brilliant mingling of gay colors and dark faces.
As he stood before the Chief, there was a clapping of hands
to call an Indian woman, the Queen of the Appamattock,
who brought water to wash the captive's hands, while another
brought a bunch of feathers to dry them on. "What
next?" Captain Smith wondered as he watched further preparations
being made, evidently for a feast, of which he was
soon asked to partake.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances his appetite was not keen, but
he felt obliged to pretend to a relish that he did not feel,
and while he was eating his eyes lighted up with pleasure as
he saw by her father's side&mdash;though he did not know then
of the relationship&mdash;the little Indian girl whose interest in
him had been so apparent when he saw her in the village.
He dared not smile in response to her vivid glance, but his
gaze lingered long on the vision of youth and loveliness, and
he turned back to his meal with a better appetite.</p>

<p>The feast at an end, Powhatan called his councilors to
his side, and while they were in earnest debate Captain
Smith knew only too well that his fate was hanging in the
balance. At last a stalwart brave arose and spoke to the
assemblage. The captive, so he said, was known to be the
leading spirit among the white settlers whose colony was
too near the Indians' homes to please them, also in his expedition
in search of corn he had killed four Indian warriors
with "mysterious weapons which spoke with the voice of
thunder and breathed the lightning," and he had been
spying on their land, trying to find some secret means by
which to betray them. With him out of the way their
country would be freed from a dangerous menace, therefore
he was condemned to death.</p>

<p>Doomed to die! Although he did not understand their
words, there was no misunderstanding their intention.
Immediately two great stones were rolled into the hall, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the feet of Powhatan, and the Captain was seized roughly,
dragged forward and forced to lie down in such a position
that his head lay across the stones. Life looked sweet
to him as he reviewed it in a moment of quick survey while
waiting for the warriors' clubs to dash out his brains. He
closed his eyes. Powhatan gave the fatal signal&mdash;the clubs
quivered in the hands of the executioners. A piercing shriek
rang out, as Pocahontas darted from her father's side,
sprang between the uplifted clubs of the savages and the
prostrate Captain, twining her arms around his neck and
laying her own bright head in such a position that to kill
the captive would be to kill the Werowance's dearest
daughter.</p>

<span class="caption">POCAHONTAS SAVES CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH</span>
</div>

<div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
</div>

<p>With horror at this staying of his royal purpose, and at
the sight of his child with her arms around the white man's
neck, Powhatan stared as if at a hideous vision, and closed
his ears to the sound of her voice as her defiant Indian words
rang out:</p>

<p>"No! He shall not die!"</p>

<p>The savages stood with upraised weapons; Powhatan
sat rigid in the intensity of his emotion. Watching him
closely for some sign of relenting, Pocahontas, without moving
from her position, began to plead with the stern old
Chief,&mdash;begged, entreated, prayed&mdash;until she had her desire.</p>

<p>"Let the prisoner go free!"</p>

<p>Through the long Council-room echoed Powhatan's order,
and a perfunctory shout rose from the savage throng, who
were always quick to echo their Chief's commands. Captain
Smith, bewildered by the sudden turn of affairs, was
helped to rise, led to the beaming girl, and told that the
condition of his release from death was that he might
"make hatchets and trinkets" for Pocahontas, the Werowance's
dearest daughter. So his deliverer was the daughter
of the great Chief! With the courtly manner which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
had brought from his life in other lands he bent over the
warm little hand of the Indian maiden with such sincere
appreciation of her brave deed that she flushed with happiness,
and she ran away with her playmates, singing as
merrily as a forest bird, leaving the pale-faced <i>Caucarouse</i>
with her royal father, that they might become better
acquainted. Although she ran off so gaily with her comrades
after having rescued Captain Smith, yet she was far
from heedless of his presence in the village, and soon
deserted her young friends to steal shyly back to the side
of the wonderful white man whose life had been saved
that he might serve her.</p>

<p>During the first days of his captivity&mdash;for it was that&mdash;the
Captain and Powhatan became very friendly, and had
many long talks by the camp-fire, by means of a sign language
and such words of the Algonquin dialect as Captain
Smith had learned since coming to Virginia. And often
Pocahontas squatted by her father's side, her eager eyes
intent on the Captain's face as he matched the old ruler's
marvelous tales of hoarded gold possessed by tribes living
to the west of Werewocomoco, with stories of the cities of
Europe he had visited, and the strange peoples he had met
in his wanderings. Sometimes as he told his thrilling tales
he would hear the little Indian maid catch her breath from
interest in his narrative, and he would smile responsively
into her upturned face, feeling a real affection for the young
girl who had saved his life.</p>

<p>From his talks with Powhatan the Englishman found out
that the great desire of the savage ruler was to own some
of the cannon and grindstones used by the colonists, and
with quick diplomacy he promised to satisfy this wish if
Powhatan would but let him go back to Jamestown and send
with him warriors to carry the coveted articles. This the
wily Indian ruler promised to do, and in return offered him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a tract of land which he did not own, and from which he
intended to push the settlers if they should take possession
of it. And Captain Smith had no intention of giving either
cannon or grindstones to Powhatan, so the shrewd old savage
and the quick-witted Captain were well matched in
diplomacy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Powhatan's interest in his white captive became
so great that he gave him the freedom he would have
accorded one of his own subjects, even allowing Pocahontas
to hunt with him, and when evening came she would sit
by the great fire and listen to her Captain's stories of his
life told with many a graphic gesture which made them clear
to her even though most of his words were unintelligible.</p>

<p>Then came a day when the captive was led to a cabin in
the heart of the forest and seated on a mat before a smoldering
fire to await he knew not what. Suddenly Powhatan appeared
before him, fantastically dressed, followed by two
hundred warriors as weirdly decorated as he was. Rushing
in, they surrounded the frightened Captain, but quickly dispelled
his fears by telling him that they were all his friends
and this was only a ceremony to celebrate his speedy return
to Jamestown, for the purpose of sending back cannon and
grindstones to their Chief.</p>

<p>This was good news. The Captain showed hearty appreciation
of the favor, and at once said his farewells.
Powhatan, the inscrutable, who bade him a dignified good-by,
repeated his promise to give him the country of the
Capahowsick, which he did not own, and said he should
forever honor him as his own son. Then, with an escort
of twelve Indians, Captain Smith set out for Jamestown,
and beside him trudged Pocahontas, looking as resolute as
if she were in truth a forest Princess escorting her chosen
cavalier through the wilderness.</p>

<p>As they picked their way along the rough trail, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Captain told her such tales of the settlement as he could make
clear to her and repeated some simple English words he
had been trying to teach her. As he talked and as she
said over and over the words she had learned, Pocahontas
gripped his arm with rapt interest and longed to follow
where he led. But night was coming on, it was unwise
for her to go beyond the last fork of the trail, and so, reluctantly,
she parted from her new and wonderful friend.
But before she left him she darted to the side of a trusty
warrior and gave a passionate command, then started swiftly
back on the long wood path leading to Werewocomoco.
The next night no one could make her laugh or join in the
dances around the big fire, nor did she show any likeness to
the light-hearted, romping, singing little tomboy, ringleader
among her playmates. Pocahontas had lost a comrade,
and her childish heart was sore at the loss. But when
the warriors returned from Jamestown she became merry
and happy again, for had the <i>Caucarouse</i> not sent her back
strings of beads more beautiful than any she had ever seen
before, such as proved surely that he had not forgotten
her?</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was, that on reaching the colony,
Captain Smith showed the Indians a grindstone and told
them to carry it back to Powhatan, but when they tried
to lift it and found its great weight they were utterly disconcerted.
Then the wily Captain showed them a cannon
purposely loaded with stones, and had it discharged among
the icicle-laden trees, which so terrified the savages that
they ran away and refused to take another look at it.
Then Captain Smith cleverly suggested that they carry
back trinkets in place of the articles which were so heavy,
and the Indians went happily away without the promised
gifts, but bearing many smaller things, some of which the
Captain was thoughtful enough to suggest be given to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Pocahontas as a slight token of his appreciation of her great service
to him.</p>

<p>Little he dreamed, man of the world though he was, that
the small courtesy would mean as much to the Indian
maiden as it did, nor could he know that from that hour
the dreams of Pocahontas were all to be built around the
daily life of the pale-faced men in the Jamestown settlement.
Even when she joined her playmates in her favorite games
of Gus-ga-e-sa-ta (deer buttons), or Gus-ka-eh (peach-pit),
or even,&mdash;tomboy that she was,&mdash;when she turned somersaults
with her favorite brother Nantaquaus and his comrades,
she was so far from being her usual lively self that the
boys and girls questioned her about the reason. In reply she
only flung back her head with an indifferent gesture, and
walked away from them. Later when the great fires blazed in
Council Hall and Long House, she sought the trusty warrior
who had accompanied Captain Smith to Jamestown, and
he gave her such news of the settlers as he had heard from
the Indians who loafed about Jamestown. They were on
friendly terms with the white men, who let them come and
go at will as long as they were peaceful and did not try to
pilfer corn or firearms.</p>

<p>Winter came with its snow and zero weather, and Pocahontas
heard of great hunger and many privations among the
colonists. She held a long secret conversation with the Indian
warrior who knew of her interest in the pale-faced
<i>Caucarouse</i>, then, at twilight of a bitter cold day, she stole
out from her wigwam, met the warrior at the beginning of
the Jamestown trail, and after carefully examining the store
of provisions which she had commanded him to bring, she
plunged into the gloomy wood trail with her escort, hurrying
along the rough path in the darkness, until she reached the
rough stockade guarding the entrance to the settlement.</p>

<p>The man on watch, who had heard many glowing

descriptions of the maiden who had saved his Captain's life,
recognized her at once and admired her exceedingly as she
stood there in her dusky imperiousness, demanding to see
the Captain. Astonished, but pleased at her coming, Smith
quickly came to greet her and was enthusiastic in his thanks
for the provisions she had brought. Then by the flare of
a torch he showed his eager guest as much of their little
village as could be seen in the fast-falling darkness, enjoying
her questions and her keen interest in such buildings
and articles as she had never seen before. She responded
to the Englishmen's cordiality with shy, appreciative glances
and would have liked to linger, but it was too late for her to
remain longer, and the colonists crowded around her with
expressions of regret that she must leave and renewed
thanks for her gifts. Then Pocahontas and her Indian escort
started back toward Werewocomoco, taking the trail
with flying feet that her absence might not be discovered.</p>

<p>From that day she often found her way to Jamestown,
carrying stores of provisions from her father's well-filled
larder, sometimes going in broad daylight, with rosy cheeks
and flying hair, after her morning swim in the river, at other
times starting out on her errand of mercy at twilight, always
protected by a faithful warrior who was on terms
of intimacy with the settlers and felt a deep pride in their
admiration for Pocahontas, whom they called "The Little
Angel," and well they might, for they would have gone without
food many a time during that bitter winter but for her
visits.</p>

<p>As for Powhatan, he was too well accustomed to the forest
excursions of his "dearest daughter," and to having her
roam the neighboring country at will, to watch her carefully.
He knew that his daughter was safe on Indian territory,
never dreaming that she would go beyond it, and as
her guide was loyal, there was no one to prevent her from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
following out her heart's desires in taking food to her Captain
and his people.</p>

<p>But as time went on and Powhatan heard more of the
wonderful firearms and useful articles possessed by the
white men, he became not only bitterly jealous of them,
but determined to secure their arms and articles for his own
use. "So when the valiant Captain made another visit to
Werewocomoco and tried to barter beads and other trinkets
for corn, the old chief refused to trade except for the coveted
firearms, which the Captain declined to give. But he did
give him a boy named Thomas Salvage, whom Powhatan
adopted as his son, and in exchange gave Smith an Indian
boy, Namontack. Then there were three days of feasting
and dancing, but of trading there was none, and Captain
Smith was determined to get corn." He showed Powhatan
some blue beads which took the Indian ruler's fancy and
he offered a small amount of corn in exchange for them, but
the Captain laughed scornfully. Those beads were the
favorite possession of Kings and Queens in other countries,
why should they be sold to Powhatan? he asked. Powhatan
became eager&mdash;offered more corn. The Captain hesitated,
shook his head, and played his part in the transaction so
well that when at last he gave in, he had secured three
hundred bushels of corn for the really worthless beads!</p>

<p>In the following months the Indians threw off their mask
of friendliness for the colonists and began to steal the firearms
so coveted by Powhatan. For some time the white
men were patient under the annoyance, but when knives
and swords began to go, a watch was set for the thieves,
and nine of them were caught and detained at the Jamestown
fort, for Captain Smith suspected treachery on Powhatan's
part and determined to hold them until all the stolen
articles were sent back. In return the Indians captured two
straggling Englishmen and came in a shouting throng to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the fort clamoring for the release of the imprisoned Indians.
Out came the bold Captain and demanded the instant freeing
of the settlers. His force and tactics were so superior
to those of the savages that they were obliged to give up
their captives. Then the Captain examined his Indian
prisoners and forced them into a confession of Powhatan's
plot to procure all the weapons possible from the colonists,
which were then to be used to kill their rightful owners.
That was all the Captain wanted of the Indians, but he still
kept them imprisoned, to give them a wholesome fright.
Powhatan, enraged at hearing of the failure of his plot
against the white men, determined that his warriors should
be freed at once. He would try another way to gain his
end. From his rustic throne in the Council Hall he sent
for Pocahontas. She was playing a game of Gaw&agrave;sa (snow-snake)
with two of her comrades, but left them instantly
and ran to the Council Hall. Long and earnestly Powhatan
talked to her, and she listened intently. When he had
finished a pleased expression flashed into her black eyes.</p>

<p>"I will do what you wish," she said, then ran back to
join in the game she had left so suddenly.</p>

<p>The next morning she went swiftly along the forest trail
now so familiar to her, and at length approached the settlers'
stockade and demanded audience with the Captain.
He was busy chopping trees at the other end of the settlement,
but dropped his ax at the summons and hurried to
bid the little maiden welcome with the courtly deference
he always showed her, whether he really felt it or not.
With folded arms and intent silence he listened to her plea:</p>

<p>For her sake would he not give up the Indians detained
in the fort as prisoners? Powhatan was very anxious that
the pleasant relations between himself and the Englishmen
should not be disturbed by such an unfriendly act as holding
his men captive. Would the noble <i>Caucarouse</i> not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
free them for the sake of that maiden who had saved his
life?</p>

<p>Captain Smith listened with a set expression and soldierly
bearing and tried to evade glancing into the girl's
eager eyes, but found it impossible. One look broke down
his iron determination, and bending over her hand with his
Old World chivalry, he said:</p>

<p>"Your request shall be granted. They shall be freed,
but not in justice, simply as an act of friendship for you,
who saved my life."</p>

<p>His intention was clear, though his words were not
understood. Joyfully Pocahontas beamed and blushed her
rapturous thanks. Smith, none too happy over the result
of Powhatan's shrewd move, called forth the sullen warriors
from the fort, and sent them on their way back to Werewocomoco,
led by victorious Pocahontas.</p>

<p>But the Indian girl did not spend all of her time in such
heroic deeds as this, nor in dreaming of the pale-faced
<i>Caucarouse</i>. She was usually the merry, care-free child of
the forest and daily led her mates in sport and dance.
Once when the Captain went to Werewocomoco to confer
with Powhatan on matters concerning neighboring tribes,
and found the great Chief away from home, Pocahontas
did the honors of the village in her father's place. After
sending an Indian runner to request the old ruler to return,
she invited Smith and his companions to be seated in an
open space before the huge fire which had been built for
their benefit.</p>

<p>There, with the clear starlit sky over their heads, and
the forest on all sides, they awaited the pleasure of their
dusky hostess. But she remained away from them for so
long that they grew uneasy, fearing some plot against them.
While the Captain was wondering what to do in case of
treachery, the woods suddenly resounded with wild shrieks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and hideous yells. All jumped to their feet, but stepped
back at sight of Pocahontas, who darted from the woods to
the Captain's side and said that there was nothing to fear,
that she would not allow a hair of the white men's heads
to be injured, but had merely arranged a masquerade to
amuse her guests while they awaited Powhatan's coming.
Then she flitted back into the forest, and presently she
danced out, leading a band of thirty young Indian girls,
whose bodies were all stained with puccoon and painted with
gay colors, while such garments as they wore were made
of brilliant green leaves. "Pocahontas, as leader, wore a
head-dress of buck's horns and girdle of otter-skin; across
her shoulder was slung a quiver filled with arrows, and
she carried a bow. Her companions all carried rattles
made of dried gourds, or clubs, or wooden swords as they
rushed out of the forest yelling and swaying to weird music
while they formed a ring around the fire. There they joined
hands and kept on dancing and singing in a weird, fantastic
way for an hour, when at a whoop from their leader they all
ran into the forest, but soon came back in their ordinary
Indian dress, to spread a feast before the white men and
spend the remainder of the evening in dancing and revels,
after which, by the light of flaming torches, they escorted
their guests to their tents for the night."</p>

<p>The next morning Powhatan came back, and was told
Captain Smith's errand. He had come to invite the old
Werowance to visit Jamestown, to receive gifts which
Captain Newport, a colonist who had just come back from
England, had brought from King James. The King had
been much interested in what Newport told him about the
Indian ruler, and thought it would be a fine idea to send
him back some presents, also a crown, which he suggested
might be placed on the savage's head with the ceremonies
of a coronation, and the robe thrown over his shoulders,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
while he was proclaimed Emperor of his own domains.
This ceremony, King James thought, might bring about a
warmer friendship between the red men and the colonists,&mdash;a
result much to be desired. And so Captain Smith gave
the invitation while Pocahontas, never far away when her
<i>Caucarouse</i> was at Werewocomoco, listened eagerly for her
father's reply.</p>

<p>Powhatan received the invitation in silence and smoked
a long time before answering. Then he said:</p>

<p>"If your King has sent me presents, I also am a King,
and this is my land. Eight days will I stay to receive
them. Your father (Newport) is to come to me, not I to
him, nor yet to your fort."</p>

<p>Wily Powhatan! He had no intention of visiting the
white men's stronghold, when by so doing he might walk
into some trap they had laid for him!</p>

<p>And so Pocahontas was disappointed in her eager hope
of going with her father to the settlement where her white
friends lived, and where she could see her wonderful Captain
daily. But there was no help for it. Powhatan resisted
both her pleading and the arguments of the Captain,
who was obliged to carry back the old Werowance's refusal
to Captain Newport.</p>

<p>"Then we will take the gifts to him!" said Newport,
stoutly. "The King would never forgive me if I did not
carry out his wish."</p>

<p>And so to Werewocomoco went the two Captains together,
bearing their offerings to Powhatan, who received them with
dignity, and showed a mild interest when presented with a
bedstead and a basin and pitcher such as the English used.
But when Captain Smith tried to throw the coronation robe
over his shoulders he drew away haughtily, wrapped his own
mantle around him, and refused to listen to argument or
entreaty. Namontack hastily assured him that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
garments were like those worn by the English and would do
him no harm, and Pocahontas, seeing the Captain's eagerness
to accomplish his end, and also keenly interested in
this new game, begged her father to accept the beautiful
gifts. Her words influenced the old ruler, and, standing as
stiff and straight as a wooden image, he let himself be dressed
up in the garb of English royalty. Then he was told to
kneel while the crown was placed on his head, but this was
too much for even Pocahontas to expect of him. He folded
his arms and stood like a pine-tree. In vain Pocahontas
urged, in vain the two white men bent and bowed and knelt
before him to show him what he ought to do.</p>

<p>At last Captain Smith grew impatient and laid a powerful
hand on the Werowance's broad shoulders; unconsciously
he stooped. The crown was hurriedly placed on
his head, and a volley of shots was fired to show that the
ceremony was over. At the shots Powhatan sprang free
like a wild creature, sure that he had been trapped, and
Captain Smith appealed to Pocahontas to explain to her
terrified father that the firing was only part of the program.
Meanwhile both Captains bowed ceremoniously before the
savage ruler, calling him by his new title&mdash;Emperor&mdash;and
finally soothed and reassured, he stood as erect and dignified
as of old, and beckoning majestically to Namontack,
bade him bring his old moccasins and mantle to send to
King James in return for the crown and robe!</p>

<p>Much amused, Captain Newport thanked him and received
the gift, but told him that more than moccasins or
mantles, the Englishmen desired his aid in attacking a
neighboring and hostile tribe. In this desire, however,
Powhatan showed no interest, and the two Captains were
obliged to leave Werewocomoco without his co-operation,
which would have been of much benefit in subduing the
unfriendly tribe. But the coronation ceremony had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
accomplished; that was one thing for which to be thankful
and Captain Newport had for the first time seen the charming
Indian girl who had become such an ally of the settlers,
so he felt well repaid for the visit, although to him
Pocahontas showed none of the spontaneous sympathy
which she gave so joyously to Captain Smith.</p>

<p>And now again came winter and with it privation and
hunger for the colonists. Corn must be procured. There
was only one man stout-hearted enough to venture on another
expedition in search of it, and that was Captain
Smith. He decided to go to Werewocomoco once more, and
if he found the new-made Emperor rebellious, to promptly
make him prisoner and carry away his stores of corn by
force.</p>

<p>While the Captain and his men were making ready to
start on the expedition, to their great surprise messengers
arrived from Powhatan inviting Captain Smith to visit
Werewocomoco again if he would bring with him men to
build a house and give the Emperor a grindstone, fifty
swords, some firearms, a hen and rooster, and much beads
and copper, for which he would be given corn.</p>

<p>Immediately forty-six Englishmen set out on a snowy
December day, in two barges and a pinnace, for Werewocomoco.
The first night they spent at the Indian village
of Warrasqueake, where a friendly chief warned Captain
Smith not to go further.</p>

<p>"You shall find Powhatan to use you kindly," he said,
"but trust him not, and be sure he have no opportunity to
seize on your arms, for he hath sent for you only to cut
your throats."</p>

<p>On hearing these words many of his comrades would have
turned back, but the Captain spoke to them in such courageous
words that in spite of the warning all continued on
their way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
While they were journeying on toward their destination,
Pocahontas, at Werewocomoco, was daily with her father,
watching him with alert ears and eyes, for she saw that the
old ruler was brooding over some matter of grave import,
and she drew her own inference. Only when planning to
wage war on an alien tribe or plotting against the Jamestown
settlers did he so mope and muse and fail to respond
to her overtures. Late one evening, when she saw two of
his loyal warriors steal to his side, in order to hear their
conversation better she climbed a near-by tree and listened
to their muttered words. Her suspicions were confirmed.
There was need of her intervention again. From that moment
until she had foiled Powhatan's design, she was on
guard day and night watching and waiting for the coming
of the Englishmen, often lying sleepless in her wigwam to
listen for some unwonted noise in the hushed forest.</p>

<p>When the party from Jamestown reached the Indian village
the river was frozen over for a half-mile from shore.
With his usual impetuous courage the Captain broke the
ice by jumping into the frozen stream, and swam ashore,
followed by the others, who were ashamed to be less courageous
than he. It was nearly night, and they took possession
of a deserted wigwam in the woods near the shore
and sent word to Powhatan that they were in immediate
need of food, as their journey had been a long one, and asked
if he would not send provisions at once. In response an
Indian runner came to their wigwam bearing bread, turkeys,
and venison, much to the delight of the half-starved colonists.
Refreshed by a good meal, they slept heavily in the still
forest, and early the next morning went to pay their respects
to Powhatan, who was in his "Chief Place of Council"
awaiting their visit in his gala robe of luxurious skins and
elaborate feather head-dress. His greeting was courteous,
but he at once turned to Captain Smith and asked:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
"When are you going away? I did not invite you to
come."</p>

<p>Although taken by surprise, quick-witted Captain Smith
did not show his feelings, but pointing to a group of Indian
warriors standing near, he said:</p>

<p>"There are the very men who came to Jamestown to
invite us here!"</p>

<p>At this Powhatan gave a guttural laugh and changed the
subject at once, by asking to see the articles which Captain
Smith had brought for exchange. Then began a long and
hot discussion in which neither the Captain nor the wily
Emperor gained a point. Powhatan refused to trade unless
the white men left their firearms on their barges and
would barter corn only for the coveted articles. Captain
Smith would not accede to his demands even to get the
much-needed corn, and was on his guard because of the
warning he had received, knowing that Powhatan was only
waiting for the right moment to kill him.</p>

<p>The debate went on for hours, during which there had
been only one trade made when Smith exchanged a copper
kettle for forty bushels of corn. Annoyed at this, he determined
to take matters into his own hand. Beckoning
to some friendly Indians, he asked them to go to the river
bank and signal to his men on the barges to come ashore
with baskets to take back the corn for which he had traded
the kettle. Meanwhile he kept up a brisk conversation with
the old Werowance to divert his attention, assuring him
that on the next day he and his men would leave their firearms
on the ships, trusting to Powhatan's promise that no
harm should come to them.</p>

<p>Powhatan was too clever to be fooled by any such delightful
promise; he knew the quick-witted Captain was
probably playing the same game that he was, and feared
lest the white man should be quicker than he at it. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
slyly whispered a command to a young warrior, and at a
sign from him two gaily decorated squaws darted forward
and, squatting at the feet of the Captain, began to sing
tribal songs to the beating of drums and shaking of rattles,
and while they sang Powhatan silently drew his fur robe
about him and stole away to a forest retreat long prepared
for an hour of danger. Before him went a supply of provisions,
and with him some women and children, but not
Pocahontas. Meeting her father in his hasty flight, she
listened to his request that she go with him, but with
a laughing gesture of refusal she fled through the woods
to the place where the white men were grouped. The
old Chief's power over his daughter had been greatly
weakened by the coming of the colonists to Jamestown,
and who knows what a fire of envy that may have kindled
in his heart?</p>

<p>As soon as the Emperor reached his hiding-place, he sent
an old Sachem in war paint and feathers back to Captain
Smith, bearing a valuable bracelet as an offering, and saying
that his chief had fled because he feared the white man's
weapons, but if they could be laid aside, he, Powhatan,
would return to give the colonists an abundance of corn.
Captain Smith, with arms folded and flashing eyes, refused
the bracelet and the request, and the Sachem went back to
carry the news to Powhatan.</p>

<p>Pocahontas had watched the interview with breathless
interest, and when she saw the old warrior turn away, and
knew that Captain Smith had foiled her father's intent,
she knew that the brave <i>Caucarouse</i> was in great danger.
That night, while all the Englishmen except their leader
were out hunting, the Captain sat alone in his wigwam
musing on ways and means to gain his end. There was a
sound in the still forest&mdash;a crackling of underbrush&mdash;he
roused at a light touch on his arm. Pocahontas stood by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
his side, alone in the darkness; swiftly she whispered her
message and he understood its gravity only too well.</p>

<p>"My father is going to send you food, and, if you eat it,
you will die," she said. "It is not safe for you to stay here
any longer. Oh, go! I beg you, go!"</p>

<p>She was shivering in her fear for his safety, and the Captain
was deeply moved by her emotion. Raising her hand
to his lips in his wonted fashion, he thanked her and offered
her the choicest beads in his store for a remembrance, but
she would not accept them!</p>

<p>"He would want to know where I got them, and then he
would kill me, too," she said, and vanished as silently and
swiftly as she had come.</p>

<p>As she had reported, soon there came warriors from Powhatan
bearing huge vessels filled with food, smoking hot.
The Chief had returned to Werewocomoco, they said, and
wished to show his good-will to the white men. Would
they partake of a feast which he had sent?</p>

<p>They set down their burden of tempting food, and the
Captain's eyes gleamed; with a profound bow he thanked
Powhatan for his courtesy, but he said:</p>

<p>"When we English make a feast for any one, we ourselves
first taste each dish before we offer it to our guests. If you
would have me eat what you have brought, you must first
taste of each dish yourselves."</p>

<p>His manner was defiant as he stood waiting for them
to accept his challenge, and, seeing they made no move
to touch what they had brought, he said, still more defiantly:</p>

<p>"Tell your Chief to come on and attack us. We are
ready for you!"</p>

<p>So soldierly was he, that the frightened Indians turned
and fled, while the colonists hastily threw away the food
Powhatan had sent. The old ruler had again been checkmated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
by his daughter's loyalty to the white men and the
Captain's courage.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, when the tide was right, the
white men were able to leave Werewocomoco, and all on
board the barges drew sighs of relief as they sailed away
from the Emperor's stronghold.</p>

<p>While they had been absent from Jamestown a party
had set out for a neighboring island, but a great storm having
come up, their boat had been swamped and all on board
drowned. As they were the men who had been left in
charge of the colony during Smith's absence, it was necessary
to send him word immediately, and one of the survivors,
Richard Wyffin, was sent on the errand. When he arrived
at Werewocomoco the colonists had left, and Powhatan was
in a sullen fury against them for having outwitted him.
Wyffin's life was in danger, and he must escape as quickly
as possible. Pocahontas hurried to his rescue and at a
moment when there were no Indians to see, she took him
to a forest hiding-place where he could safely spend the
night. Later, under cover of the darkness, she crept to
the spot, awakened him and led him to the edge of the
woods, directing him to take the opposite trail from that
on which her father's braves were watching to capture him.
And so he escaped and joined the other colonists at Pamunkey,
where they had gone from Werewocomoco, Captain
Smith being determined either to get corn from Opechancanough
or to burn his storehouses, for he, like Powhatan,
had promised to trade with the white men. But he proved
treacherous, too, and Captain Smith, exasperated and desperate,
sprang on him and "in a fierce encounter nearly
knocked the breath out of his huge body, then jammed him up
against the wall, placed the muzzle of his gun at his breast,
and, seizing him by his scalp-lock, dragged him out into full
view of his assembled subjects and gave him the alternative&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
"'Your corn or your life!'</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances Opechancanough promptly decided
to give the corn, and with a ship full of the much-needed
provisions the settlers sailed triumphantly back to
Jamestown."</p>

<p>When this was reported to Powhatan it greatly increased
his respect for the pale-faced <i>Caucarouse</i>, but he was still
enraged at the failure of his plan to kill him, and he commanded
his warriors to capture him as soon as possible;
but meanwhile events occurred which worked for the Captain's
good. A Chickahominy Indian had stolen various
articles from the settlers, among them a pistol. He escaped,
but his two brothers, who were known to be his accomplices,
were captured and one held in the Jamestown fort, while
the other was told to go for the pistol, and if he did not
return with it in twelve hours his brother would be hung.
Away went the Indian&mdash;while the Captain took pity on the
poor naked wretch imprisoned in the cold cell and sent
him some food and charcoal for a fire&mdash;the fumes from
which suffocated him. When his brother came back with
the pistol he lay senseless on the ground. Captain Smith at
once hurried to the spot and worked so hard to revive him
that he recovered, and the next morning was well enough
to leave the fort with his brother, both of them having been
given substantial presents of copper. The story was told
among the tribe as a miracle, and the belief became current
that to his other virtues the brave Captain added that of
being able to raise men from the dead. Then one of Powhatan's
warriors secretly secured a bag of gunpowder and
pretended that he could use it as the English did. His
dusky comrades crowded around to watch him manage the
strange article, but in some way it caught fire, and blew
him, with one or two more, to death. This happening so
awed and terrified those Indians who saw the accident that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
they began to be superstitious about the knowledge of the
settlers, who could make such powerful things obey their
will. It was better to be a friend than foe of the white
man, so even Powhatan concluded, and warriors from all
the neighboring tribes came to Jamestown bringing presents,
also stolen articles, and begging for friendly relations instead
of attempting to capture Captain Smith.</p>

<p>Then came an event which forever changed the life of
Pocahontas, the Captain's staunch admirer. He, after having
adventured up the James River to visit a struggling
colony there, was sailing down the river feeling weary and
discouraged, as he had many enemies working against him
at Jamestown, and was so disheartened that he determined
to leave Virginia forever. As he lay musing and trying
to sleep in the stern of the ship, a bag of gunpowder exploded,
wounding him so badly that he leaped into the
water to cool the burning agony of his flesh. He was
rescued and the ship sailed for Jamestown with all possible
haste. His wounds were dressed, but he was in a dangerous
condition and there was no skilled surgeon to care for him,
so his plight was pitiable. An Indian carried the sad news
to Pocahontas, who at once deserted her comrades for solitary
brooding in the forest. Then she took the long wood
trail to Jamestown. Hours later one of the settlers found
her standing outside the stockade, peering through the
cracks between the logs as though it were some comfort
to see into the village where her Captain lay&mdash;that Captain
who held her heart in his keeping. She would have stood
there less quietly had she known that an enemy of his had
stolen into his cabin and at that very moment was holding
a pistol to the wounded man's bosom, trying to nerve himself
to do a deed he had been bribed to do! But his
courage failed, his hand dropped, and he crept out into the
silent night, leaving the wounded man unharmed. While
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Pocahontas stood on tiptoe outside the stockade, straining
her eager eyes for a glimpse of the Captain's cabin,
there were footsteps beside her&mdash;a hand was laid on her
shoulder, and a voice asked:</p>

<p>"Why are you here at such an hour, Pocahontas?"</p>

<p>It was one of the colonists who was Captain Smith's
loyal friend. Pocahontas turned to him, gripping her slender
hands together in an agony of appeal.</p>

<p>"He is not dead?" she asked. The man shook his head
and a glad light flashed into the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"He has many enemies," she said. "Can you do nothing
to nurse him back to health?"</p>

<p>Tears stood in her black eyes, and her appeal would have
softened a heart less interested in the Captain's welfare
than was her hearer's. Promising to watch over the brave
Captain and care for him as his own kin, the white man
soothed and comforted Pocahontas, and at last induced
her to leave her place at the fort and go back to Werewocomoco,
and never did the Captain know of her long vigil
for his sake that night.</p>

<p>Reaching the Indian village without her absence having
been discovered, she went about her daily routine of work
and play as if nothing had happened, but every sound in
the still forest caused her heart to beat fast, and she was
always listening for an approaching footstep bringing news
of her beloved. Then a warrior brought the tidings&mdash;Captain
Smith was dead. Dead! She could not, would not
believe it! <i>Dead!</i> He who was so full of life and vigor
was not dead&mdash;that was too absurd. And yet even as she
reasoned with herself, she accepted the fact without question
with the immobility of her race; and no one guessed
the depth of her wound, even though all the tribe had
known of her devotion to the pale-faced <i>Caucarouse</i> whose
life she had saved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
From that day she went no more to Jamestown, nor
asked for news of the settlers, and soon the gay voice and
the laughing eyes of the "little romp" were missing, too,
from Werewocomoco. Pocahontas could not bear the sights
and sounds of that village whose every tree and trail was
dear to her because of its association with her Captain.
She had relatives among the Potomacks, and to them she
went for a long visit, where in different surroundings she
could more easily bear the loneliness which overpowered
her, child of a savage and unemotional race though she
was. It may have been also that Powhatan was beginning
to distrust her friendship with the white men. At all events,
she, who was fast blossoming into the most perfect womanhood
of her race, remained away from home for many
months. Had she dreamed that Captain Smith was not
dead, but had sailed for England that he might have proper
care for his injury, and also because of the increasing enmity
against him in the colony, she would have gone about her
work and play with a lighter heart. But she thought him
dead, and in the mystic faith of her people saw him living
in every tree and cloud and blossoming thing.</p>

<p>Powhatan had respected Captain Smith, but for the white
men as a race he had more enmity than liking, and now he
and his neighbors, the Chickahominies, again refused to
send any provisions to Jamestown, and again the colonists
faced a famine. Captain Argall, in command of an English
ship, suggested once more going to Werewocomoco to force
Powhatan into giving them corn, and soon sailed up the
Potomac toward the Indian village. One night on the
way up, while the ship lay at anchor near shore, an Indian
came aboard with the news that the Emperor's dearest
daughter, Pocahontas, was staying among the Potomacks
visiting a chief named Japazaws. The unscrupulous Captain
had an idea. If he could capture Pocahontas and hold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
her for a ransom he would surely be able to gain anything
he demanded from Powhatan. No thought of the kindness
and loyalty of the Indian maiden to the white man interfered
with his scheming. Corn he must have, and here
was a way to obtain it. He quickly arranged with the Indian
for an interview with the Chief Japazaws, who proved
to be quite as unscrupulous as Captain Argall, and for a copper
kettle promised to deliver Pocahontas into the Captain's
hands&mdash;in fact, to bring her aboard his vessel on the
following day.</p>

<p>Having taken his wife into his confidence, Japazaws told
her in the presence of Pocahontas that the white Captain
had invited her to visit his ship. She retorted that she
would like to accept, but would not go unless Pocahontas
would go too. Japazaws pretended to be very angry at
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you to go," he exclaimed; "if you do not accept
I will beat you until you do."</p>

<p>But the squaw was firm.</p>

<p>"I will not go without Pocahontas," she declared.</p>

<p>Pocahontas was very kind-hearted, as the chief and his
wife knew, so at once she said:</p>

<p>"Stop beating her; I will do as she wishes!"</p>

<p>Captain Argall gave them a cordial greeting and had a
lavish feast prepared in their honor, and while they were
talking together he asked Pocahontas if she would not like
to see the gun-room. She assented, entirely unsuspicious
of any treachery, and was horrified when she heard the door
fastened behind her, and knew that for some reason she was a
prisoner. Terror-stricken,&mdash;brave girl though she was,&mdash;she
pounded violently on the door and cried as she had never
cried before in all her care-free life, begging "Let me out!"
but in vain. She could hear Japazaws and his wife weeping
even more violently than she on the other side of the door,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and begging for her release, but it was only a pretense. The
door remained locked, and as soon as the couple were given
the copper kettle and a few trinkets, they left the ship
contentedly. After that there was an ominous silence on
the vessel, except for the sobbing of the Indian girl, who
was still more frightened as she felt the motion of the ship
and knew they were getting under way.</p>

<p>But as they sailed down the river to Jamestown, the
captain unlocked the door and the girl was allowed to
come out of her prison. She faced him with a passionate
question:</p>

<p>"What wrong have I done that I should be so treated&mdash;I
who have been always the loyal friend of the English?"</p>

<p>So noble was she in her youth and innocence, that the
captain was horrified at the deed he had done and could do
no less than tell her the truth. He assured her that she had
done no wrong, that he well knew that she was the white
man's friend, and that no harm should befall her, but that
it was necessary to take firm measures to secure provisions
for the starving colonists. Hearing this, she was less
frightened and became quiet, if not in spirit, at least in manner,
giving no cause for trouble as they entered the harbor.
But her heart was filled with sadness when she again saw
that fort to which she had so often gone with aid for her
vanished friend whose name now never passed her lips.</p>

<p>Indian girls mature rapidly, and the maiden who had first
attracted Captain Smith's attention was no less lovely now,
but she was in the full flower of womanliness and her charm
and dignity of carriage compelled respect from all.</p>

<p>Powhatan was in his Place of Council when a messenger
from Jamestown demanded audience with him and gave
his message in quick, jerky sentences:</p>

<p>"Your daughter Pocahontas has been taken captive by
the Englishmen," he said. "She will be held until you send
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
back to Jamestown all the guns, tools, and men stolen from
them by your warriors."</p>

<p>The old chief, terrified, grief-stricken, and in a dilemma,
knew not what to say, for though he loved his daughter,
he was determined to keep the firearms taken from the
English. For a long time he was deep in thought. Finally
he replied:</p>

<p>"The white men will not harm my child, who was their
very good friend. They know my wrath will fall on them
if they harm a hair of her head. Let her remain with them
until I shall have made my decision."</p>

<p>Not another word would he say, but strode out from the
Council Hall and was lost in the forest.</p>

<p>Three months went by without the Englishmen receiving
a word from him, and Pocahontas meanwhile became their
inspiration and joy, giving no sign that she feared her captors
or objected to her captivity. Then Powhatan sent
seven white men who had been held by the Indians to the
settlement, carrying a gun which had been spoiled for use.
Their leader brought this message from the Indian Emperor:</p>

<p>"If you will send back my daughter I will send you five
hundred bushels of corn and be your friend forever. I have
no more guns to return, as the remainder have been lost."</p>

<p>Prompt was the retort:</p>

<p>"Tell your Chief that his daughter will not be restored
to him until our demand has been complied with. We do
not believe that the guns have been lost."</p>

<p>The runner took back the message, and again nothing
more was heard from Powhatan for several months, during
which time the colonists became so deeply attached to the
young captive that they dreaded to think of the settlement
without her cheery presence. Especially did John Rolfe, a
young widower, who was by report "an English gentleman
of approved behavior and honest carriage," feel a special
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
interest in the charming young savage; in fact he fell in
love with her, but felt that he must convert her to the
Christian religion before asking her to become his wife.
So he devoted much time to instructing her in the doctrines
of the white man's faith. Pocahontas accepted the new
religion eagerly, and little did John Rolfe guess that to
her it was the religion of Captain John Smith,&mdash;a new tie
binding her to the man who she believed had gone forever
beyond her sight, but who would be forever dearest to
her loyal heart, untutored girl of the forest though she was.
It is doubtful, too, whether John Rolfe would ever have
made any headway in her affection had she not believed her
beloved Captain to be dead. However that may have
been, she became a convert to Christianity, and John Rolfe
asked her to marry him.</p>

<p>When almost a year had gone by with no word from
Powhatan, the colonists were very angry and decided to
force the issue. A party in command of Sir Thomas Dale,
who had come from England to be the leader of the Jamestown
settlement, sailed for Werewocomoco, taking Pocahontas
with them, hoping that when Powhatan heard of
the presence of his dearest daughter at his very door he
would relent and yield to their demands.</p>

<p>But Powhatan was not at Werewocomoco. Anticipating
just such a visit, he was in a safe retreat, and his warriors
who thronged to the river bank to meet the white men at
once attacked them, and there was lively skirmishing until
two brothers of Pocahontas heard of her arrival. Hurrying
to the river bank, they quelled the turmoil and hastily
paddled out to the ship, where they were soon standing
beside their sister, seeing with joy that despite her captivity
she was well and happy, with the same merry light in her
black eyes as she had in her forest days. Their feeling
deepened into awe when with downcast eyes and flushed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
cheeks she told them of John Rolfe's love for her and of her
attachment for him. Their sister girl of the forest, kin of
the red men,&mdash;going to marry an Englishman from that marvelous
land across the sea, of which one of their tribe who
had visited it had brought back the report: "Count the
stars in the sky, the leaves on the trees, and the sand upon
the seashore&mdash;such is the number of the people of England!"
Pocahontas, their little sister, going to marry an Englishman!&mdash;the
stalwart Indian boys could scarcely believe the
tale, and on leaving the ship they hurried to their father's
forest retreat to tell their wondrous tale. The old Chief
listened with inscrutable reserve, but his eyes gleamed with
exultation and in his heart he rejoiced. His daughter, child
of an Indian Werowance, to become wife of a white man,&mdash;the
two races to be united? Surely this would be a greater
advantage than all the firearms that could be bought or
stolen!</p>

<p>But if he expected that the breach between the white
men and the red would be at once healed, he was mistaken.
Although Pocahontas greeted her brothers so cordially, she
would have nothing to do with her father or any of his
braves, and when Powhatan desired to see her she sent
back the imperious message:</p>

<p>"Tell him if he had loved his daughter he would not
have valued her less than old swords, pieces, and axes;
wherefore will I still dwell with the Englishmen who love
me!"</p>

<p>And back to Jamestown she presently sailed with those
men of the race to which she had been loyal even in her
captivity.</p>

<p>That Powhatan did not resent her refusal to see him
after his long silence, but probably admired her for her determination,
was soon shown. Ten days after the party
reached Jamestown an Indian warrior, Opachisco, uncle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Pocahontas, and two of her brothers, arrived there, sent
by Powhatan to show his approval of his daughter's alliance
with an Englishman, although nothing would have induced
him to visit the white man's settlement himself, even to
witness the marriage of his dearest daughter.</p>

<p>Having become a convert to the white man's faith, Pocahontas
was baptized according to the ritual of the Christian
church, taking the name of Rebecca, and as she was the
daughter of an Emperor, she was afterwards called "Lady
Rebecca;" but to those who had known her in childhood
she would ever be Pocahontas, the "little romp."</p>

<p>And now the Indian maiden, who by her loyalty to the
white race had changed the course of her life, was about to
merge her identity in that of the colonists:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On a balmy April day, with sunshine streaming through
the open windows of the Jamestown chapel, the rude place
of worship was filled to overflowing with colonists, all eagerly
interested in the wedding of John Rolfe with the dusky
princess who was the first Christian Indian in Virginia."</p>

<p>The rustic chapel had been decorated with woodland
blossoms, and its windows garlanded with vines. Its
columns were pine-trees cut from the forest, its rude pews
of sweet-smelling cedar, and its simple Communion table
covered with bread made from wheat grown in neighboring
fields, and with wine from the luscious wild grapes picked
in near-by woods.</p>

<p>There, in the beauty and fragrance of the spring day,
up the aisle of the chapel passed the young Indian bride
on the arm of John Rolfe, who looked every inch an English
gentleman in his cavalier's costume. And very lovely
was the new-made Lady Rebecca in her gown of white
muslin with its richly embroidered over-dress given by Sir
Thomas Dale. Her head-dress of birds' plumage was
banded across her forehead, Indian fashion, with a jeweled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
fillet, which also caught her floating veil, worn in the English
way, which emphasized her dark beauty. On her wrists
gleamed many bracelets, and in her deep eyes was the look
of one who glimpses the future and fears it not.</p>

<p>Slowly they advanced up the aisle, and halted before the
altar, a picturesque procession; the grave, dignified Englishman,
who now and again cast adoring glances at his girlish
bride, of an alien forest race; the old Chief of a savage
tribe, in his gay ceremonial trappings and head-dress; the
two stalwart, bronzed young braves, keenly interested in
this great event in their sister's life, all in a strange commingling
of Old World and New, auguring good for the
future of both Indians and colonists.</p>

<p>The minister of the colony repeated the simple service,
and Lady Rebecca, in her pretty but imperfect English, repeated
her marriage vows and accepted the wedding-ring
of civilized races as calmly as if she had not been by birth
a free forest creature. Then, the service ended, down the
aisle, in the flickering sunlight, passed the procession, and
there at the chapel door, surrounded by the great forest
trees which had been her lifelong comrades, and with the
wide sky spreading over her in blue benediction, we have a
last glimpse of the "little romp," for Pocahontas, the Indian
maiden, had become Lady Rebecca, wife of John Rolfe,
the Englishman.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Three years later Pocahontas, for so we still find it in our
hearts to call her, visited England with her husband and
little son Thomas, to see with her own eyes that land across
the sea where her husband had been brought up, and of
which she had heard such wonderful tales. One can well
imagine the wonder of the girl of the forest when she found
herself out of sight of land, on the uncharted ocean of which
she had only skirted the shores before, and many a night she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
stole from her cabin during that long voyage to watch the
mysterious sea in its majestic swell, and the star-sown
heavens, as the ship moved slowly on to its destination.</p>

<p>London, too, was a revelation to her with its big buildings,
its surging crowds of white men, its marks of civilization
everywhere, and, girl of the outdoors that she had ever
been, her presentation at Court, with all that went before
and after of the frivolities and conventionalities of city life,
must have been a still greater marvel to her. But the
greatest surprise of all awaited her. One day at a public
reception a new-comer was announced, and without warning
she found herself face to face with that Captain of her
heart's youthful devotion! There was a moment's silence,
a strained expression in the young wife's dark eyes, then
Captain John Smith bent over the hand of John Rolfe's
wife with the courtly deference he had given in Virginian
days to the little Indian girl who was his loyal friend.</p>

<p>"They told me you were dead!"</p>

<p>It was Pocahontas who with quivering lips broke the
silence, then without waiting for a reply she left the room
and was not seen for hours. When she again met and talked
with the brave Captain, she was as composed as usual,
and no one could say how deeply her heart was touched to
see again the friend of her girlhood days. Perhaps the unexpected
sight of him brought with it a wave of home-sickness
for the land of her birth and days of care-free happiness,
perhaps she felt a stab of pain that the man to
whom she had given so much had not sent her a message
on leaving the country, but had let her believe the rumor
of his death&mdash;perhaps the heart of Pocahontas was still
loyal to her first love, devoted wife and mother though she
was. Whatever may have been the truth, Lady Rebecca
was proud and calm in the presence of the Captain after
that first moment, and had many conversations with him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which increased his admiration for the gracious forest
Princess, now a lady of distinction in his own land.</p>

<p>The climate of England did not agree with Pocahontas,
her health failed rapidly, and in the hope that a return
to Virginia would save her life, her husband took passage
for home. But it was too late; after a sickness of only a
few hours, she died, and John Rolfe was left without the
vivid presence which had been his blessing and his joy.</p>

<p>Pocahontas was buried at Gravesend on the 21st of
March, 1617, and as night fell, and John Rolfe tossed on a
bed of anguished memories, it is said that a man muffled in
a great cloak stole through the darkness and knelt beside
the new-made grave with bowed head and clasped hands.</p>

<p>It was Captain Smith who came to offer reverent tribute
to the girl who had given him so much, asking nothing in
return, a girl of savage lineage, yet of noble character and
great charm, whose blossoming into the flower of civilization
had no parallel. Alone there, in the somber night, the
silent figure knelt&mdash;the brave Captain of her loyal devotion
paying tardy homage to Pocahontas, the girl of the Virginia
forest, the white man's steadfast friend.</p>

<h2>DOROTHY QUINCY: THE GIRL OF COLONIAL
DAYS WHO HEARD THE FIRST GUN
FIRED FOR INDEPENDENCE</h2>


<p>A small, shapely foot clad in silken hose and satin
slipper of palest gray was thrust from under flowing
petticoats of the same pale shade, as Dorothy Quincy stepped
daintily out of church on a Sabbath Day in June after
attending divine service.</p>

<p>John Hancock, also coming from church, noted the small
foot with interest, and his keen eye traveled from the
slipper to its owner's lovely face framed in a gray bonnet,
in the depths of which nestled a bunch of rosebuds. From
that moment Hancock's fate as a man was as surely settled
as was his destiny among patriots when the British seized
his sloop, the <i>Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>But all that belongs to a later part of our story, and we
must first turn back the pages of history and become better
acquainted with that young person whose slippered foot so
diverted a man's thoughts from the sermon he had heard
preached on that Lord's Day in June.</p>

<p>Pretty Dorothy was the youngest daughter of Edmund
Quincy, one of a long line of that same name, who were
directly descended from Edmund Quincy, pioneer, who
came to America in 1628. Seven years later the town of
Boston granted him land in the town that was afterward
known as Braintree, Massachusetts, where he built the
mansion that became the home of succeeding generations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of Quincys, from whom the North End of the town was
later named.</p>

<p>As his father had been before him, Dorothy's father was
a judge, and he spent a part of each year in his home on
Summer Street, Boston, pursuing his profession. There in
the Summer Street home Dorothy was born on the tenth
of May, 1747, the youngest of ten children. Evidently she
was sent to school at an early age, and gave promise of a
quick mind even then, for in a letter written by Judge
Quincy, from Boston to his wife in the country, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Daughter Dolly looks very Comfortable, and has gone to School,
where she seems to be very high in her Mistresses' graces.</p>
</div>

<p>But the happiest memories of Dorothy's childhood and
early girlhood were not of Boston, but of months spent in
the rambling old mansion at Quincy, which, although it
had been remodeled by her grandfather, yet retained its
quaint charm, and boasted more than one secret passage and
cupboard, as well as a "haunted chamber" without which
no house of the period was complete.</p>

<p>There we find the child romping across velvety lawns,
picking posies in the box-bordered garden, drinking water
crystal clear drawn from the old well, and playing many a
prank and game in the big, roomy home which housed such
a lively flock of young people. Being the baby of the
family, it was natural that Dorothy should be a great pet,
not only of her brothers and sisters, but of their friends,
especially those young men&mdash;some of whom were later the
principal men of the Province&mdash;who were attracted to the
old mansion by Judge Quincy's charming daughters. So
persistent was little Dolly's interest in her sisters' friends,
that it became a jest among them that he who would woo
and win fascinating Esther, sparkling Sarah, or the equally
lovely Elizabeth or Katherine Quincy, must first gain the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
good-will of the little girl who was so much in evidence,
many times when the adoring swain would have preferred
to see his lady love alone. Dorothy used to tell laughingly
in later years of the rides she took on the shoulders of Jonathan
Sewall, who married Esther Quincy, of the many small
gifts and subtle devices used by other would-be suitors as
bribes either to enlist the child's sympathies in gaining their
end, or as a reward for her absence at some interesting and
sentimental crisis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Quincy, who before her marriage was Elizabeth
Wendall, of New York, was in full sympathy with her light-hearted,
lively family of boys and girls. Although the
household had for its deeper inspiration those Christian
principles which were the governing factors in family life
of the colonists, and prayers were offered morning and
night by the assembled family, while the Sabbath was
kept strictly as a day for church-going and quiet reflection,
yet the atmosphere of the home was one of hospitable
welcome. This made it a popular gathering-place not only
for the young people of the neighborhood, but also for more
than one youth who came from the town of Boston, ten
miles away, attracted by the bevy of girls in the old mansion.</p>

<p>Judge Quincy was not only a devout Christian and a
respected member of the community, he was also a fine
linguist. He was so well informed on many subjects that,
while he was by birth and tradition a Conservative, giving
absolute loyalty to the mother country, and desirous of obeying
her slightest dictate, yet he was so much more broad-minded
than many of his party that he welcomed in his
home even those admirers of his daughters who were determined
to resist what they termed the unjust commands of
the English Government. Among these patriots-to-be who
came often to the Quincy home was John Adams, in later
days the second President of the United States, and who was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a boy of old Braintree and a comrade of John Hancock,
whose future history was to be closely linked with the new
and independent America. Hancock was, at the time of his
first visit to the old Quincy mansion, a brilliant young man,
drawn to the Judge's home by an overwhelming desire to
see more of pretty Dorothy, whose slippered foot stepping
from the old meeting-house had roused his interest. Up to
the time when he began to come to the house, little Dorothy
was still considered a child by her brothers and sisters,
her aims and ambitions were laughed at, if she voiced
them, and she was treated as the family pet and plaything
rather than a girl rapidly blossoming into very beautiful
womanhood.</p>

<p>As she saw one after another of her sisters become engaged
to the man of her choice, watched the happy bustle
of preparation in the household, then took part in the wedding
festivities, and saw the bride pass out of the old mansion
to become mistress of a home of her own, Dorothy was
quick to perceive the important part played by man in a
woman's life, and, young as she was, she felt within herself
that power of fascination which was to be hers to so great
a degree in the coming years. Dorothy had dark eyes
which were wells of feeling when she was deeply moved,
her hair was velvet smooth, and also dark, and the play of
feelings grave and gay which lighted up her mobile face
when in conversation was a constant charm to those who
knew the vivacious girl. When she first met John Hancock
she had won an enviable popularity by reason of her
beauty and grace, and was admired and sought after even
more than her sisters had been; yet no compliments or
admiration spoiled her sweet naturalness or her charm of
manner.</p>

<p>In those days girls married when they were very young,
but Dorothy withstood all the adoration which was poured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
at her feet beyond the time when she might naturally have
chosen a husband, because her standards were so high that
not one of her admirers came near to satisfying them. But
in her heart there was an Ideal Man who had come to occupy
the first place in her affection.</p>

<p>As she had sat by her father's side, night after night,
listening while John Adams spoke with hot enthusiasm of
his friend John Hancock, the boy of Braintree, now a rising
young citizen of Boston, the resolute advocate of justice for
the colonies, who stood unflinchingly against the demands
of the mother country, where he thought them unfair,&mdash;the
conversation had roused her enthusiasm for this unknown
hero, until she silently erected an altar within her heart to
this ideal of manly virtues.</p>

<p>Then John Hancock came to the old mansion to seek the
girl who had attracted his attention on that Sabbath Day
in June, little dreaming that in those conversations which
Dorothy had heard between her father and John Adams
she had pieced together a complete biography of her Hero.
She knew that in 1737, when the Reverend John Hancock
was minister of the First Church in the North Precinct of
Braintree (afterward Quincy), he had made the following
entry in the parish register of births:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">John Hancock, my son, January 16, 1737.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Dorothy also knew that there in the simple parsonage
the minister's son grew up, and together with his brother
and sister enjoyed the usual life of a child in the country.
When he was seven years old his father died, leaving very
little money for the support of the widow and three children.
Thomas Hancock, his uncle, was at that time the richest
merchant in Boston, and had also married a daughter of
a prosperous bookseller who was heir to no small fortune
herself. The couple being childless, at the death of John
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Hancock's father they adopted the boy, who was at once
taken from the simple parsonage to Thomas Hancock's
mansion on Beacon Hill, which must have seemed like a
fairy palace to the minister's son, as he "climbed the grand
steps and entered the paneled hall with its broad staircase,
carved balusters, and a chiming clock surmounted with
carved figures, gilt with burnished gold." There were also
portraits of dignitaries on the walls of the great drawing-room,
which were very impressive in their lace ruffles and
velvet costumes of the period, and many articles of furniture
of which the country boy did not even know the names.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, he was sent to the Boston Public
Latin School, and later to Harvard College, from which he
graduated on July 17, 1754, when he was seventeen years
old&mdash;at a time when pretty Dorothy Quincy was a child
of seven.</p>

<p>From the time of his adoption of his nephew, Thomas
Hancock had determined to have him as his successor in
the shipping business he had so successfully built up, and
so, fresh from college, the young man entered into the business
life of Boston, and as the adopted son of a rich and
influential merchant, was sought after by mothers with
marriageable daughters, and by the daughters themselves,
to whose charms he was strangely indifferent.</p>

<p>For six years he worked faithfully and with a good judgment
that pleased his uncle, while at the same time he took
part in the amusements of the young people of Boston who
belonged to the wealthy class, and who copied their diversions
from those in vogue among young folk in London.
The brilliant and fine-looking young man was in constant
demand for riding, hunting, and skating parties, or often
in winter for a sleigh-ride to some country tavern, followed
by supper and a dance; or in summer for an excursion down
the harbor, a picnic on the islands, or a tea-party in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
country and a homeward drive by moonlight. Besides
these gaieties there were frequent musters of militia, of which
Hancock was a member, and he was very fond of shooting
and fishing; so with work and play he was more than busy
until he was twenty-three years old. Then his uncle sent
him to London to give him the advantages of travel and of
mingling with "foreign lords of trade and finance," and
also to gain a knowledge of business conditions in England.
And so, in 1760, young Hancock arrived in London, where
he found "old Europe passing into the modern. Victory
had followed the English flag in every quarter of the globe,
and a new nation was beginning to evolve out of chaos in
the American wilderness, which was at that time England's
most valuable dependency."</p>

<p>While he was in London George the Second died, and his
grandson succeeded to the throne. The unwonted sight of
the pomp and splendor of a royal funeral was no slight
event in the life of the young colonist, and the keen eyes of
John Hancock lost no detail of the imposing ceremonial.
He wrote home:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I am very busy in getting myself mourning upon the Occasion of the
Death of his late Majesty King George the 2d, to which every person of
any Note here Conforms, even to the deepest Mourning.... Everything
here is now very dull. All Plays are stopt and no diversions are going
forward, so that I am at a loss how to dispose of myself....</p>
</div>

<p>A later letter is of interest as it shows something of the
habits of a wealthy young man of the period. "Johnny,"
as his uncle affectionately calls him, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I observe in your Letter you mention a Circumstance in Regard to
my dress. I hope it did not Arise from your hearing I was too Extravagant
that way, which I think they cant Tax me with. At same time I am
not Remarkable for the Plainness of my Dress, upon proper Occasions
I dress as Genteel as anyone, and cant say I am without Lace.... I find
money some way or other goes very fast, but I think I can Reflect it has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
been spent with Satisfaction, and to my own honor.... I endeavor to be
in Character in all I do, and in all my Expences which are pretty large I
have great Satisfaction in the Reflection of their being incurred in Honorable
Company and to my Advantage.</p>
</div>

<p>Throughout his life good fortune followed John Hancock
in matters small and great, and it was a piece of characteristic
good luck that he should have been able to remain
to see the new King's coronation. He was also presented
at Court, as a representative young colonist of high social
standing, and was given a snuff-box by His Majesty as a
token of his good-will to one of his subjects from across
the sea.</p>

<p>Before leaving for home he learned all he could in regard
to the commercial relations between England and her
colonies, and after hearing the great orator Pitt make a
stirring speech against unjust taxation, he realized how
much more daring in word and act were some loyal British
subjects than the colonists would have thought possible.
Doubtless to Pitt the young patriot-to-be owed his first inspiration
to serve the colonies, though it bore no fruit for
many months.</p>

<p>October of 1761 found young Hancock again in Boston,
and a year later he was taken into partnership with his
uncle. This gave him a still greater vogue among the
Boston belles who admired him for his strength of character
and for his fine appearance, as he was noted for being
the best dressed young man in Boston at that time. It is
said that "his taste was correct, his judgment of quality
unsurpassed, and his knowledge of fashions in London aided
by recent residence there." We are told that "a gold-laced
coat of broadcloth, red, blue or violet; a white-satin waistcoat
embroidered; velvet breeches, green, lilac or blue;
white-silk stockings and shoes flashing with buckles of silver
or gold; linen trimmed with lace," made the prosperous young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
merchant outshine others of his position, "and made it
appear that by birth at least he belonged to the wealthy
and fashionably conservative class."</p>

<p>His uncle was indeed such a strong Conservative that
he was unwilling to have his adopted son show any leaning
to the radical party. But when on the first of August, 1764,
Thomas Hancock died of apoplexy, leaving his Beacon Hill
mansion and fifty thousand dollars to his widow, Lydia
Hancock, and to John his warehouses, ships, and the residue
of his estate, in the twinkling of an eye the young man
became a prominent factor in the business world of the day,
as the sole owner of an extensive export and import trade.
But more important to him than the fortune which he had
inherited was the knowledge that he was now at liberty
to speak and act in accordance with his own feelings in
regard to matters about which his views were slowly but
surely changing.</p>

<p>He was now twenty-seven years old, and on paying a
flying visit to his friend John Adams, in the home of his
early childhood, attended divine service in his father's old
church, and thrilled at the glimpse he had of Judge Quincy's
youngest daughter, Dorothy, demurely leaving the meeting-house.
Dolly was then seventeen years of age, and as
lovely in her girlish beauty as any rose that ever bloomed,
and John Hancock's feeling of interest in her was far too
keen to allow that glimpse to be his last.</p>

<p>He and John Adams visited the Quincy homestead, and
young Hancock listened respectfully to the Judge's reminiscences
of his father; but at the same time he watched pretty
Dorothy, who flitted in and out of the room, giving no hint
of her emotion at having an opportunity to listen to the
deep voice and note the clear-cut features and brilliant eyes
of the Hero of her dreams. She only cast her eyes down
demurely, glancing from under her long lashes now and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
again, when a remark was addressed to her. She was quick
to see that her father, while as cordial to his visitor as good
breeding demanded, yet wished him to feel that he was not
in sympathy with the radical views now openly expressed
by the young Boston merchant. Judge Quincy, as we have
seen, was a broad-minded, patriotic man, yet being by birth
a staunch Conservative, he felt it his duty to show the
younger generation what real loyalty to the mother country
meant, and that it did not include such rebellion against
her commands as they were beginning to express. However,
he chatted pleasantly with Hancock and his friend
Adams, and when they took their leave, Hancock was invited
both to call on the family in Boston and to return
to the Quincy homestead. Dorothy seconded the invitation
with a momentary lifting of her eyes to his, then became
demure, but in the glance that passed between them
something was given and taken which was to last for all
time, and to add its deepest joy to the future life of pretty
Dorothy.</p>

<p>It was certainly love at first sight for John Hancock,
and to the young girl his love soon became the one worth-while
thing in life.</p>

<p>Not many months after that first visit of John Hancock's
to Dorothy's home, he paid Judge Quincy a formal visit in
Boston and asked for the hand of his youngest daughter in
marriage. As a matter of course, the Judge was flattered,
for who was a more eligible match than this rich and
handsome young Bostonian? On the other hand, he was
sorry to include one of England's rebellious subjects in his
family, and he declared so plainly. John Hancock was
polite but positive, as he was about everything, and let it
be clearly understood that no objection to his suit would
make any difference in its final outcome. He and Dorothy
loved each other&mdash;that was all that really mattered. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
sincerely hoped that her father would come to approve of
the match, for he would ever consider, he said, Dorothy's
happiness before his own. But he clearly stated that he
should stand by those words and deeds of the radical party
which he believed best for the colonies, despite any effort
which might be made to change any of his opinions; also
he was going to marry Dorothy. Evidently his determination
won the Judge's consent, and in giving it he smothered
his objections, for there was no further opposition to the
match, and no courtship ever gave clearer evidence of an
intense devotion on both sides than that of Hancock and
Dorothy, who, being ten years younger than her Hero,
looked up to him as to some great and superior being worthy
of her heart's supreme devotion.</p>

<p>Political events of vital importance to the colonies happened
in swift succession, and Dorothy's Hancock quickly
took his place in the front rank of those who were to be
the backbone in the colonies' struggle for liberty, although
at that time his activity against English injustice was
largely due to his wish to protect his own business interests.
In 1765 the Stamp Act was passed, and John
Hancock openly denounced it and declared he would not
use the stamps.</p>

<p>"I will not be made a slave without my consent," he
said. "Not a man in England, in proportion to estate,
pays the tax that I do."</p>

<p>And he stood by that declaration, becoming generally
recognized as a man of ability and of great power, on
whom public duties and responsibilities could be placed
with assurance that they would be successfully carried
out. While he was deeply occupied with colonial affairs
Dorothy Quincy was busy in her home with those duties
and diversions which formed the greater part of a young
woman's daily life in those days, but always in spirit she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was with her lover, and she thrilled with pride at each new
proof of his fearlessness and growing patriotism.</p>

<p>In September, 1768, when it was rumored that troops
had been ordered from Halifax, in an attempt of England
to quell the spirit of independence rife among her colonists,
Samuel Adams, John Hancock, John Adams, and James
Otis waited upon the Governor to ask if the report were
true, and to request him to call a special meeting of the
Assembly. He declined to do it, and a meeting of protest
was held in Faneuil Hall, with representatives from ninety-six
towns present, at which meeting it was resolved that
"they would peril their lives and their fortunes to defend
their rights:" "That money cannot be granted nor a
standing army kept up in the province but by their own free
consent."</p>

<p>The storm was gathering, and ominous clouds hung low
over the town of Boston on a day soon after the meeting
in Faneuil Hall, when seven armed vessels from Halifax
brought troops up the harbor to a wharf at which they
landed, and tramped by the sullen crowd of spectators with
colors flying, drums beating&mdash;as if entering a conquered
city. Naturally the inhabitants of Boston would give them
no aid in securing quarters, so they were obliged to camp
on the Common, near enough to Dorothy Quincy's home on
Summer Street to annoy her by the noise of their morning
drills, and to make her realize in what peril her lover's life
would be if he became more active in public affairs at this
critical period.</p>

<p>If any stimulus to John Hancock's growing patriotism
was needed it was given on the tenth of June, when one of
his vessels, a new sloop, the <i>Liberty</i>, arrived in port with a
cargo of Madeira wine, the duty on which was much larger
than on other wines. "The collector of the port was so inquisitive
about the cargo, that the crew locked him below
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
while it was swung ashore and a false bill of entry made
out, after an evasive manner into which importers had
fallen of late. Naturally enough, when the collector was
released from the hold, he reported the outrage to the commander
of one of the ships which had brought troops from
Halifax, and he promptly seized the <i>Liberty</i> and moved it
under his ship's guns to prevent its recapture by Bostonians."
This was one of the first acts of violence in the days
preceding the struggle for Independence in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>While John Hancock was so fully occupied with public
matters, he yet found time to see his Dolly frequently, and
her sorrow was his when in 1769 Mrs. Quincy died, and
Dorothy, after having had her protecting love and care for
twenty-two years, was left motherless. The young girl
was no coward, and her brave acceptance of the sorrow won
her lover even more completely than before, while his
Aunt Lydia, who had become deeply attached to pretty
Dorothy, and was eager to have her adopted son's romance
end happily, lavished much care and affection on the girl
and insisted that she visit her home on Beacon Hill frequently.
Possibly, too, Aunt Lydia may have been uneasy
lest Judge Quincy, left without the wise counsels of
his wife, might insist that his daughter sever her connection
with such a radical as Hancock had become. In any
case, after her mother's death, Dorothy spent much of her
time with her lover's Aunt Lydia, and Hancock was much
envied for the charms of his vivacious bride-to-be. In fact,
it has been said that "not to have been attracted to Dorothy
Quincy would have argued a heart of steel," of which there
are but few. To her lover she was all and more than
woman had ever been before, in charm and grace and
beauty, and he who among men was noted for his stern
resolve and unyielding demeanor was as wax in the hands
of the young woman, who ruled him with gentle tyranny.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
To Dorothy her lover was handsome and brilliant beyond
even the Hero of her girlish dreams; her love was too sacred
for expression, even to him who was its rightful possessor.
He appealed to her in a hundred ways, she delighted
in his "distinguished presence, his inborn courtesy,
his scrupulous toilets;" she adored him for "his devotion
to those he loved, his unusual generosity to friends and inferiors,"
and she thrilled at the thought of his patriotism,
his rapid advancement. And if, as has been said, crowds
were swayed by his magnetism, what wonder that it touched
and captivated Dorothy Quincy, the object of his heart's
deepest devotion?</p>

<p>On the fifth of March, 1770, British soldiers fired on a
crowd in the streets of Boston, and the riot that ensued,
in which the killing of six and the injury to a half-dozen
more, was dignified by the name of a "Massacre." Blood
was now at boiling-point, and the struggle between the
mother country and her colonists had commenced. Private
meetings were beginning to be held for public action,
and John Adams, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and
Josiah Quincy, a nephew of Dorothy's father, and an ardent
believer in American liberty, were among the leading spirits
who took notice of every infringement of rights on the
part of the government and its agents. In the House of
Representatives they originated almost every measure for
the public good, and the people believed them to be the
loyal guardians of their rights and privileges.</p>

<p>John Hancock, who at first had stood out against taxation
without representation because of his own business
interests, now stood firmly for American Independence for
the good of the majority, with little left of the self-seeking
spirit which had animated his earlier efforts. Occupied
as he now was with the many duties incident on a public
life, it is said he was never too busy to redress a wrong,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and never unwilling to give lavishly where there was need,
and Dorothy Quincy rejoiced as she noted that many measures
for the good of the country were stamped with her
lover's name.</p>

<p>On the very day of the so-called "Boston Massacre"
Great Britain repealed an Act recently passed which had
placed a heavy duty on many articles of import. That
tax was now lifted from all articles except tea, on which it
was retained, to maintain the right of Parliament to tax
the colonies, and to show the King's determination to have
his way.</p>

<p>"In resistance of this tax the Massachusetts colonists gave
up drinking their favorite beverage and drank coffee in its
place. The King, angry at this rebellion against the dictates
of Parliament, refused to lift the tax, and tea was
shipped to America as if there were no feeling against its
acceptance. In New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston
mass-meetings of the people voted that the agents to whom
it had been shipped should be ordered to resign their offices.
At Philadelphia the tea-ship was met and sent back to
England without being allowed to come to anchor. At
Charleston the tea was landed, but as there was no one
there to receive it, or pay the duty, it was thrown into a
damp cellar and left there to spoil. In Boston things were
managed differently. When the <i>Dartmouth</i>, tea-laden, sailed
into the harbor, the ship, with two others which soon arrived
and anchored near the <i>Dartmouth</i>, was not allowed to dock."</p>

<p>A meeting of citizens was hastily called, and a resolution
adopted that "tea on no account should be allowed to
land." The tea-ships were guarded by a committee of
Boston patriots who refused to give permits for the vessels to
return to England with their cargoes. Then came what has
been called Boston's "picturesque refusal to pay the tax."
As night fell Samuel Adams rose in a mass-meeting and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
said, "This meeting can do nothing more to save the
country." As the words fell from his lips there was a shout
in the street and a group of forty men disguised as "Mohawks"
darted past the door and down to the wharves,
followed by the people. Rushing on board the tea-ships,
the disguised citizens set themselves to cleaning the vessels
of their cargoes. As one of them afterward related: "We
mounted the ships and <i>made tea in a trice</i>. This done, I
mounted my team and went home, as an honest man should."</p>

<p>Twilight was gathering when the Indian masqueraders
began their work, and it was nearly three hours later when
their task was done. Boston Harbor was a great teapot,
with the contents of three hundred and forty-two chests
broken open and their contents scattered on the quiet
water. A sharp watch was kept that none of it should be
stolen, but a few grains were shaken out of a shoe, which
may be seen to-day in a glass jar in Memorial Hall, Boston.
And this was the famous "Boston Tea-Party"!</p>

<p>Men's passions were now aroused to fever heat, and the
actions of the patriots were sharply resented by the conservatives
who upheld the government, while the radicals
were fighting for the rights of the people. In all the acts
of overt rebellion with which John Hancock's name was
constantly connected he was loyally and proudly upheld by
his Dorothy, who, despite her inborn coquetry, daily became
better fitted to be the wife of a man such as John Hancock.</p>

<p>But though she stood by him so bravely in all his undertakings,
and would not have had him recede one step from
the stand he had taken, yet there was much to alarm her.
Because of his connection with the Boston Tea-Party, and
other acts of rebellion, the soldiers of the crown had distributed
royalist hand-bills broadcast, with this heading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"TO THE SOLDIERS OF HIS MAJESTY'S TROOPS IN BOSTON"</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
There followed a list of the authors of the rebellion, among
whom were Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and Josiah
Quincy. The hand-bill also announced that "it was probable
that the King's standard would soon be erected," and
continued: "The friends of our king and country and of
America hope and expect it from you soldiers the instant
rebellion happens, that you will put the above persons immediately
to the sword, destroy their houses and plunder
their effects. It is just they should be the first victims to
the mischiefs they have brought upon us."</p>

<p>Reason enough for Hancock's Dorothy to be apprehensive,
beneath her show of bravery!</p>

<p>In January, 1775, the patriots made an effort to show
that they were still loyal subjects, for they sent a petition
from the Continental Congress to the King, wherein they
asked "but for peace, liberty and safety," and stated that
"your royal authority over us, and our connection with
Great Britain, we shall always carefully and zealously endeavor
to support and maintain."</p>

<p>Despite this the oppressions increased, and the persistent
roughness of the British troops continued unchecked.
In March an inhabitant of Billerica, Massachusetts, was
tarred and feathered by a party of his majesty's soldiers.
A remonstrance was sent to General Gage, the king's chosen
representative in the colony, in which was this clause:</p>

<p>"We beg, Your Excellency that the breach, now too
wide, between Great Britain and this province may not, by
such brutality of the troops, still be increased.... If it
continues, we shall hereafter use a different style from that
of petition and complaint."</p>

<p>In reply from London came the news that seventy-eight
thousand guns and bayonets were on their way to America.
Also came a report that orders had gone out to arrest John
Hancock, William Otis, and six other head men of Boston.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
The informant, a friend of Hancock's, added: "My heart
aches for Mr. Hancock. Send off expresses immediately
to tell him that they intend to seize his estate, and have his
fine house for General...."</p>

<p>April of 1775 came, and the Provincial Congress met at
Concord, Massachusetts, and took upon itself the power to
make and carry out laws. Immediately General Gage
issued a proclamation stating that the Congress was "an
unlawful assembly, tending to subvert government and to
lead directly to sedition, treason, and rebellion.</p>

<p>"And yet even in the face of such an ominous outlook the
indefatigable Massachusetts patriots continued to struggle
for their ideal of independence. John Adams, himself a
patriot of the highest class, asserted that Samuel Adams,
John Hancock, and James Otis were the three most important
characters of the day, and Great Britain knew it.
Certainly all four men were feared in the mother country,
and Hancock's independence of the government brought
several suits against him." Like those of his co-workers
for freedom from tyranny, his nerves were now strung to
the highest tension, and he spent many a sleepless night
planning how best to achieve his high purposes and grim
resolves, while his love for pretty Dorothy was the one
green spot in the arid desert of colonial strife.</p>

<p>Boston was no longer a safe place for those who could
change it for a more peaceful place of residence. Judge
Quincy, who had been keeping a close watch over his
own business affairs, now decided to leave for Lancaster,
where his married daughter, Mrs. Greenleaf, lived. All
homes were completely disorganized, and by the time
the Judge decided to leave most of his friends had already
gone, taking their household goods with them out of harm's
way. All social life was ended, and it was indeed a suitable
prelude to a grim period of American history.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
When the Judge decided to take refuge in Lancaster,
the question was, should Dorothy go, too? Her lover was
in Concord, where the Provincial Congress was in session.
Knowing the condition of affairs in Boston, he had not returned
to his home during the intermissions of the session,
finding it more convenient to stay in Concord and spend
his Sundays in Lexington, where he and John Adams were
warmly welcomed at the home of the Rev. Jonas Clark, a
Hancock cousin.</p>

<p>Now, when Hancock heard of Judge Quincy's plan to
leave Boston for Lancaster, he wrote immediately to his
Aunt Lydia and made an appeal calculated to touch a much
more stony heart than hers. Would she take his Dolly
under her protection until the state of colonial affairs should
become more peaceful? Boston was no place for a woman
who could be out of it; but on the other hand, neither was
a town as far away as Lancaster a suitable retreat for a girl
with a lover who might get only occasional glimpses of her
there. Would his <i>dear</i> aunt please call on Judge Quincy,
and, after putting the matter squarely before him, try to
bring his Dolly away to Lexington with her? The Rev. Mr.
Clark would welcome them as warmly as he and Adams
had been received, and give them a comfortable home as
long as necessary. Would his aunt not do this for him?
As a final appeal he added that if General Gage should carry
out his intention of seizing Adams and himself, he might
have a few more chances to see the girl he loved.</p>

<p>Aunt Lydia was quick in her response. Of course she
would do as he wished. It would be far better for the
motherless girl to be under her protection at this time than
with any one else, and she could understand perfectly her
nephew's desire to be under the same roof even for a brief
time with his dear Dolly. She would see the Judge immediately.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
At once her stately coach was ordered out, and soon
it rolled up before the Quincy door to set down Aunt Lydia,
intent on achieving her end. And she did. Although the
Judge was not altogether pleased with the idea of being
separated from Dorothy, he saw the wisdom of the plan
and assented to it. Dorothy, with a girl's light-heartedness
at the prospect of a change, especially one which meant
seeing her lover, hastily packed up enough clothing for use
during a brief visit. Then she said an affectionate farewell
to her father, little dreaming what an eventful separation
it was to be, and rode away by the side of Aunt Lydia, who
was delighted that she had been able to so successfully
manage the Judge, and that she was to have cheerful
Dorothy for a companion during days of dark depression.</p>

<p>To Lexington they went, and as John Hancock had predicted,
the Rev. Mr. Clark gave them a cordial welcome.
Hancock was there to greet them, and with great satisfaction
the elder woman saw the lovers' rapturous meeting, and
knew that her diplomacy had brought this joy to them.</p>

<p>When the excitement of the meeting had somewhat subsided,
they talked long and earnestly of the critical situation,
and Dorothy, with her hand clasped close in her
lover's, heard with sudden terror of a rumor that General
Gage intended to seize Adams and Hancock at the earliest
opportunity. But roses bloomed in her cheeks again as
she declared, proudly: "I have no fear! You will be
clever enough to evade them. No cause as worthy as yours
will have as a reward for its champion such a fate as to
be captured!"</p>

<p>Seeing her flashing eyes and courageous thrusting aside
of possibilities, that he might not count her a coward, John
Hancock loved her better than before, and tenderly raised
her hand to his lips with a simple: "God bless you, dear.
I hope you may be right!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
And now, in quiet Lexington, Dorothy and Aunt Lydia
occupied themselves with such daily tasks as they were
able to accomplish in the minister's home, and the girl
was bewildering in her varied charms as John Hancock
saw them displayed in daily life during their brief but
precious meetings. Dorothy enjoyed an occasional letter
from a cousin, Helena Bayard, who was still in Boston, and
who gave lively accounts of what was happening there.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Bayard lived in a boarding-house, she saw many
persons who knew nothing of her relatives, and one day,
after returning from a visit, she found the parlor full of
boarders, who eagerly asked her if she had heard the news.
She said she had not, and in a letter to Dorothy later, she
gives this spicy account of what she heard:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I was told that Linsee was coming, and ten thousand troops, which
was glorious news for the Congress. Mr. Hancock was next brought on
the carpet, and as the company did not suspect I had the least acquaintance
with him, I can't think they meant to affront me.</p>

<p>However, as Mr. Hancock has an elegant house and well situated, and
this will always be a garrison town, it will do exceedingly well for a fort,
... "I wonder how Miss ... will stand affected? I think he defers marrying
until he returns from England." At this speech I saw a wink given,
and all was hush!&mdash;myself as hush as the grave, for reasons. "Mr. Hancock
has a number of horses. Perhaps he would be glad to dispose of
them, as the officers are buying up the best horses in town"&mdash;Mrs. Bayard,
don't look so dull! You will be taken the greatest care of! Thought
I,&mdash;if you knew my heart, you would have the most reason to look dull.
However, a little time will decide that.</p>

<p>I am, you will say, wicked, but I wish the small-pox would spread.
Dolly, I could swell my letter into a balloon, but lest I should tire you,
I will beg my sincere regards to Mr. Hancock, and beg the favor of a line
from my dear Dolly,</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate Coz</p>

<p class="sig">Helena Bayard.</p>
</div>

<p>Dorothy's eyes flashed as she read this, and laying it
down she exclaimed: "We will see whether the British come
off victorious or not! If I mistake not, there is more ability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in the finger-tip of John Hancock than in those of all the
generals in the English army. You will be taken the
greatest care of, indeed&mdash;We shall see what we shall see!"
with which sage remark pretty Dolly, head held high, walked
out of the room and gave vent to her feelings in vigorous
exercise.</p>

<p>The issue was to be confronted sooner than they knew,
and it was peaceful Lexington where the first alarm of war
sounded.</p>

<p>According to advice, a messenger had been sent to Concord
to warn Hancock of his possible danger, but neither he
nor Adams attached much importance to the report, after
their first alarm was over, and they were enjoying the quiet
village life of Lexington with the two women guests at the
parsonage, when on the eighteenth of April, General Gage
really did order a force to march on Concord, not so much
to seize the few military supplies stored there, as to capture
the rebellious enemies of the crown.</p>

<p>Just how a small group of men in Boston, calling themselves
the "Sons of Liberty," who had constituted themselves
a volunteer committee to watch over the movements of the
enemy, knew of the plan of the British to march to Concord,
and on the way to arrest Hancock and Samuel Adams,
will never be known. It is enough to know that they had
received the information, and knew that the British were
determined not to have a report of the march reach the
enemy until it had been successfully accomplished. The
question was how to carry the news to Lexington and Concord
ahead of the British troops. There was no time to
waste in lengthy discussions, and in a very short time Paul
Revere was ready for his historic ride. The signals agreed
on before affairs had reached this climax were: if the
British went out by water, <i>two</i> lanterns would be swung in
the North Church steeple; if they went by land, <i>one</i> would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
be shown, and a friend of Paul Revere's had been chosen
as the man to set the signal.</p>

<p>Now, on the night of the eighteenth of April, 1775, <i>two</i>
lanterns swung high in the historic steeple, and off started
Paul Revere on the most famous ride in American history.
As Longfellow has so vividly expressed it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A hurry of hoofs in a village street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was all! And yet through the gloom and the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindled the land into flame with its heat.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>With clank of spur and brave use of whip, on he dashed,
to waken the country and rouse it to instant action&mdash;and
as he passed through every hamlet heavy sleepers woke at
the sound of his ringing shout:</p>

<p>"The Regulars are coming!"</p>

<p>Then on clattered horse and rider, scattering stones and
dirt, as the horse's hoofs tore into the ground and his flanks
were flecked with foam. Midnight had struck when the
dripping steed and his breathless rider drew up before the
parsonage where unsuspecting Dorothy and Aunt Lydia
were sheltered, as well as the two patriots. The house was
guarded by eight men when Paul Revere dashed up to the
door, and they cautioned him not to make a noise.</p>

<p>"Noise!" exclaimed Revere. "You'll have noise enough
before long. The Regulars are coming out!"</p>

<p>John Hancock, ever on the alert for any unwonted sounds,
heard the commotion and recognizing Revere's voice opened
a window and said:</p>

<p>"Courier Revere, we are not afraid of you!"</p>

<p>Revere repeated his startling news.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
"Ring the Bell!" commanded Hancock. In a few moments
the church bell began to peal, according to pre-arranged
signal, to call men of the town together. All night
the tones of the clanging bell rang out on the clear air
and before daylight one hundred and fifty men had mustered
for defense, strong in their desire for resistance and confident
of the justice of it.</p>

<p>John Hancock was determined to fight with the men who
had come together so hurriedly and were so poorly equipped
for the combat. With a firm hand he cleaned his gun and
sword and put his accoutrements in order, refusing to
listen to the plea of Adams that it was not their duty to
fight, that theirs it was, rather, to safeguard their lives for
the sake of that cause to which they were so important at
this critical time. Hancock was deaf to all appeals, until
Dorothy grasped his hands in hers and forced him to look
into her eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have lost my mother," she said; "to lose you, too,
would be more than I could bear, unless I were giving you
for my country's good. But you can serve best by living
rather than by courting danger. You must go, and go now!"</p>

<p>And Hancock went.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a British officer had been sent in advance of
the troops to inquire for "Clark's parsonage." By mistake
he asked for Clark's tavern, which news was brought to
Hancock as he was debating whether to take Dorothy's advice
or not. He waited no longer. With Adams he immediately
took refuge in a thickly wooded hill back of the
parsonage. An hour later Paul Revere returned to the
house to report that after he left there, with two others,
he had been captured by British officers. Having answered
their questions evasively about the whereabouts of the
patriots, he finally said: "Gentlemen, you have missed
your aim; the bell's ringing, the town's alarmed. You are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
all dead men!" This so terrified the officers that, not one
hundred yards further on, one of them mounted Revere's
horse and rode off at top speed to give warning to the
on-coming troops, while Revere went back to report to Hancock
and Adams.</p>

<p>It was evidently unsafe for them to remain so near the
scene of the struggle, and at daylight they were ready to
start for the home of the Rev. Mr. Marrett in Woburn.
Dorothy and Aunt Lydia were to remain in Lexington, and
although they had kept well in the background through all
the excitement of the fateful night, Aunt Lydia now went
down to the door, not only to see the last of her beloved
nephew, but to try to speak to some one who could give
her more definite news of the seven hundred British soldiers
who had arrived in town and were drawn up in formidable
array against the motley company of colonists. The British
officers at once commanded the colonists to lay down
their arms and disperse. Not a single man obeyed. All
stood in silent defiance of the order. Then the British regulars
poured into the "minute-men" a fatal volley of shots;
and about that time Aunt Lydia descended to the parsonage
door, and excited Dorothy threw open her window
that she might wave to her lover until he was out of sight.
As she drew back, she saw something whiz through the air
past her aunt's head, striking the barn door beyond, and
heard her aunt exclaim:</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>It was a British bullet, and no mistake! As Dorothy
told later: "The next thing I knew, two men were being
brought into the house, one, whose head had been grazed
by a bullet, insisted that he was dead; but the other, who
was shot in the arm, behaved better."</p>

<p>Dorothy Quincy had seen the first shot fired for independence!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Never was there a more gallant resistance of a large and
well-disciplined enemy force than that shown by the minute-men
on that day at Lexington, and when at last the British
retreated under a hot fire from the provincials at whom they
had sneered, they had lost two hundred and seventy-three,
killed, wounded, and missing, while the American force
had lost only ninety-three.</p>

<p>As soon as the troops were marching on their way to Concord,
a messenger brought Dorothy a penciled note from
Hancock: "Would she and his aunt come to their hiding-place
for dinner, and would they bring with them the fine
salmon which was to have been cooked for dinner at the
parsonage?" Of course they would&mdash;only too eagerly did
they make ready and allow the messenger to guide them to
the patriot's place of concealment. There, while the lovers
enjoyed a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, Adams and Aunt Lydia made the
feast ready, and they were all about to enjoy it, when a
man rushed in crying out wildly:</p>

<p>"The British are coming! The British are coming! My
wife's in eternity now."</p>

<p>This was grim news, and there was no more thought of
feasting. Hurriedly Mr. Marrett made ready and took the
patriots to a safer hiding-place, in Amos Wyman's house in
Billerica. There, later in the day, they satisfied their
appetites as best they could with cold pork and potatoes
in place of the princely salmon, while Dorothy and Aunt
Lydia, after eating what they had heart to consume of the
feast, returned to Parson Clark's home, where they waited
as quietly as possible until the retreat of the British troops.
Then Dorothy had the joy of being again clasped in her
lover's arms&mdash;and as he looked questioningly into her dear
eyes, he could see lines of suffering and of new womanliness
carved on her face by the anxiety she had experienced during
the last twenty-four hours. Then, at a moment when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
both were seemingly happiest at being together, came their
first lovers' quarrel.</p>

<p>When she had somewhat recovered from the fear of not
seeing Hancock again, Dorothy announced that she was
going to Boston on the following day&mdash;that she was worried
about her father, who had not yet been able to leave the
city, that she must see him. Hancock listened with set lips
and grim determination:</p>

<p>"No, madam," he said, "you shall not return as long as
there is a British bayonet in Boston."</p>

<p>Quick came the characteristic reply: "Recollect, Mr.
Hancock, I am not under your control yet! I shall go to
my father to-morrow."</p>

<p>Her determination matched his own, and Hancock saw
no way to achieve his end, yet he had not thought of yielding.
As usual, he turned to Aunt Lydia for advice. She
wisely suggested retiring, without settling the mooted question,
as they were all too tired for sensible reflection on any
subject. Then, after defiant Dorothy had gone to her
room, the older woman stole to the girl's bedside, not to
advise,&mdash;oh no!&mdash;merely to suggest that there was more
than one girl waiting to step into Dorothy's place should she
flout the handsome young patriot. Also, she suggested,
how terrible it would be if Hancock should be killed, or
even captured while the girl he worshiped was away from
his side! There was no reply, and the older woman stole
from the room without any evidence that she had succeeded
in her mission. But she smiled to herself the next morning
when Dorothy announced that she had never had any real
intention of leaving for Boston, and gracefully acknowledged
to an entranced lover that <i>he</i> had been right, after
all!</p>

<p>The next question was, where should the women take
refuge until the cloud of war should have passed over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sufficiently to make it safe for them to return to their homes?
Hancock advised Fairfield, Connecticut, a beautiful town
where there would be small chance of any danger or discomfort.
His suggestion met with approval, and Mrs.
Hancock and her pretty ward at once set off for the Connecticut
town, while Adams and Hancock journeyed cautiously
toward Worcester, where they were to meet and go
with other delegates to the Continental Congress at Philadelphia.
They were detained at Worcester three days,
which gave Hancock a chance to see his Dorothy again on
her way to the new place of refuge. Theirs was a rapturous
though a brief visit together; then the patriots went on
toward New York, and Dorothy and Aunt Lydia proceeded
to Fairfield, where they were received in the home of Mr.
Thaddeus Burr, an intimate friend of the Hancocks, and a
leading citizen, whose fine colonial house was a landmark
in the village.</p>

<p>Judge Quincy, meanwhile, had at last been able to take
flight from Boston, and after a long, uncomfortable trip,
had arrived at his daughter's home in Lancaster, where he
heard that "Daughter Dolly and Hancock had taken dinner
ten days before, having driven over from Shirley for
the purpose." He writes to his son Henry of this, and adds,
"As I hear, she proceeded with Mrs. Hancock to Fairfield;
I don't expect to see her till peaceable times are restored."</p>

<p>The two patriots reached New York safely, and Hancock
at once wrote to Dorothy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="text-align: right">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Sabbath Even'g, May 7, 1775</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Dolly</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I Arrived well, tho' fatigued, at King's Bridge at Fifty Minute after
Two o'clock yesterday, where I found the Delegates of Massachusetts
and Connect' with a number of Gentlemen from New York, and a Guard
of the Troop. I dined and then set out in the Procession for New York,&mdash;the
Carriage of your Humble servant being first in the procession (of
course). When we Arrived within three Miles of the City, we were Met
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
by the Grenadier Company and Regiment of the City Militia under Arms,&mdash;Gentlemen
in Carriages and on Horseback, and many thousand of
Persons on foot, the roads fill'd with people, and the greatest cloud of dust
I ever saw. In this Situation we Entered the City, and passing thro'
the Principal Streets of New York amidst the Acclamations of Thousands
were set down at Mr. Francis's. After Entering the House three Huzzas
were Given, and the people by degrees dispersed.</p>

<p>When I got within a mile of the City my Carriage was stopt, and
Persons appearing with proper Harnesses insisted upon Taking out my
Horses and Dragging me into and through the City, a Circumstance I
would not have Taken place on any consideration, not being fond of such
Parade.</p>

<p>I beg'd and entreated that they would suspend the Design, and they
were at last prevail'd upon and I proceeded....</p>

<p>After having Rode so fast and so many Miles, you may well think I
was much fatigued, but no sooner had I got into the Room of the House
we were Visited by a great number of Gentlemen of the first Character
of the City, who took up the Evening.</p>

<p>About 10 o'clock I Sat down to Supper of Fried Oysters &amp;, at 11 o'clock
went to Capt Sear's and Lod'g. Arose at 5 o'clock, went to the House
first mentioned, Breakfasted, Dress'd and went to Meeting, where I heard
a most excellent Sermon....</p>

<p>The Grenadier Company of the City is to continue under Arms during
our stay here and we have a guard of them at our Doors Night and Day.
This is a sad mortification for the Tories. Things look well here.... I
beg you will write me. Do acquaint me every Circumstance
Relative to that Dear Aunt of Mine; write Lengthy and often.... People
move slowly out, they tell me, from Boston....
Is your Father out? As soon as you know, do acquaint me, and send
me the letters and I will then write him. Pray let me hear from you by
every post. God bless you, my Dr. Girl, and believe me most Sincerely</p>

<p class="center">Yours most affectionately</p>

<p class="sig">John Hancock.</p>
</div>

<p>One can fancy the flutter of pride in Dorothy's heart at
the reading of such honors to her lover, and she settled
down to await the turn of events with a lighter heart, while
Hancock and Adams, with the other delegates, went on
toward Philadelphia, their trip being a triumphal progress
from start to finish.</p>

<p>On the ninth of May they arrived at their destination,
and on the following day the Continental Congress met,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
when John Hancock was unanimously elected President of
the Congress.</p>

<p>While her lover was occupied with matters of such vital
importance, he always found time to pour out his hopes and
fears and doings in bulky letters which reached his lady
love by coach, every fortnight, and which&mdash;"shortened absence"
to her impatient desire for the one man in the world
who meant all to her. But even where Dorothy's heart was
so seriously engaged, she could no more help showering coquettish
smiles and pretty speeches on those residents of
Fairfield whom she came to know, than she could help bewitching
them by her charm and beauty. The more sober-minded
men of the town were delighted by her conversation,
which was sparkling, and by her keen comment on
public affairs&mdash;comment far beyond the capability of most
of her sex and age, while it became the fashion to pay court
to vivacious Dorothy, but the moment an adorer attempted
to express his sentimental feelings he found himself checkmated
by a haughty reserve that commanded admiration,
but forced an understanding that Mistress Dolly wished no
such attentions.</p>

<p>Of this John Hancock knew nothing, as Dolly was the
most tantalizingly discreet of correspondents, and poor
Hancock looked and longed in vain for written evidence of
her devotion, despite which, however, he continued to
write long letters to her:</p>

<p>In one, written on June 10, 1775, he says pathetically:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I am almost prevailed on to think that my letters to my aunt and
you are not read, for I cannot obtain a reply. I have asked a million
questions and not an answer to one.... I really take it extremely
unkind. Pray, my dear, use not so much ceremony and reservedness.... I
want long letters.... I beg my dear Dolly, you will write
me often and long letters. I will forgive the past if you will mend in
future. Do ask my aunt to make me up and send me a watch-string,
and do you make up another. I want something of your doing....</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
I have sent you in a paper Box directed to you, the following things
for your acceptance &amp; which I do insist you wear, if you do not, I shall
think the Donor is the objection.</p>

<p>2 pair white silk, 4 pair white thread stockings which I think will fit
you, 1 pr Black Satin Shoes, 1 pr Black Calem Do, the other shall be sent
when done, 1 very pretty light Hat, 1 neat airy Summer Cloak ...
2 caps, 1 Fann.</p>

<p>I wish these may please you, I shall be gratified if they do, pray write
me, I will attent to all your Commands.</p>

<p>Adieu my Dr. Girl, and believe me with great Esteem and Affection</p>

<p class="center">Yours without Reserve</p>

<p class="sig">John Hancock.</p>
</div>

<p>Surely such an appeal could not have failed of its purpose,
and we can imagine Dorothy in the pretty garments of a
lover's choosing, and her pride and pleasure in wearing them.
But little coquette that she was, she failed to properly transmit
her appreciation to the man who was so eager for it,
and at that particular time her attention was entirely taken
up by other diversions, of which, had Hancock known, he
would have considered them far more important than
colonial affairs.</p>

<p>To the Fairfield mansion, where Dolly and her aunt were
staying, had come a visitor, young Aaron Burr, a relative
of Thaddeus Burr, a brilliant and fascinating young man,
whose cleverness and charming personality made him very
acceptable to the young girl, whose presence in the house
added much zest to his visit, and to whom he paid instant
and marked attention. This roused Aunt Lydia to alarm
and apprehension, for she knew Dorothy's firmness when
she made up her mind on any subject, and feared that the
tide of her affection might turn to this fascinating youth,
for Dorothy made no secret of her enjoyment of his attentions.
This should not be, Aunt Lydia decided.</p>

<p>With determination, thinly veiled by courtesy, she walked
and talked and drove and sat with the pair, never leaving
them alone together for one moment, which strict chaperonage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Dolly resented, and complained of to a friend with as
much of petulancy as she ever showed, tossing her pretty
head with an air of defiance as she told of Aunt Lydia's
foolishness, and spoke of her new friend as a "handsome
young man with a pretty property."</p>

<p>The more devoted young Burr became to her charming
ward, the more determined became Aunt Lydia that John
Hancock should not lose what was dearer to him than his
own life. With the clever diplomacy of which she was
evidently past mistress, she managed to so mold affairs to
her liking that Aaron Burr's visit at Fairfield came to an
unexpectedly speedy end, and, although John Hancock's
letters to his aunt show no trace that he knew of a dangerous
rival, yet he seems to have suddenly decided that if
he were to wed the fair Dolly it were well to do it quickly.
And evidently he was still the one enshrined in her heart,
for in the recess of Congress between August first and
September fifth, John Hancock dropped the affairs of the
colony momentarily, and journeyed to Fairfield, never again
to be separated from her who was ever his ideal of womanhood.</p>

<p>On the 28th day of August, 1775, Dorothy Quincy and
the patriot, John Hancock, were married, as was chronicled
in the <i>New York Gazette</i> of September 4th:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This evening was married at the seat of Thaddeus Burr, at Fairfield,
Conn., by the Reverend Mr. Eliot, the Hon. John Hancock, Esq., President
of the Continental Congress, to Miss Dorothy Quincy, daughter of
Edmund Quincy, Esq., of Boston. Florus informs us that "in the second
Punic War when Hannibal besieged Rome and was very near making
himself master of it, a field upon which part of his army lay, was offered
for sale, and was immediately purchased by a Roman, in a strong assurance
that the Roman valor and courage would soon raise the siege."
Equal to the conduct of that illustrious citizen was the marriage of the
Honorable John Hancock, Esq., who, with his amiable lady, has paid
as great a compliment to American valor by marrying now while all the
colonies are as much convulsed as Rome was when Hannibal was at
her gates.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
The <i>New York Post</i> also gave a detailed account of the
wedding, and of the brilliant gathering of the "blue blood"
of the aristocratic old town as well as of the colonies. Had
the ceremony taken place in the old Quincy home, as had
originally been intended, in a room which had been specially
paneled with flowers and cupids for the auspicious
event, it would doubtless have been a more homelike affair,
especially to the bride, but it would have lacked the dignified
elegance to which the stately Burr mansion lent itself so
admirably.</p>

<p>Pretty Dorothy a bride! Mrs. John Hancock at her gallant
husband's side, receiving congratulations, with joy
shining in her dark eyes, which were lifted now and again
to her husband, only to be answered by a responsive glance
of love and loyalty. They were a handsome and a happy
pair, to whom for a few hours the strife of the colonies had
become a dream&mdash;to whom, despite the turbulent struggle
in which Hancock must soon again play such a prominent
part, the future looked rose color, because now nothing but
death could part them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Vivacious Dorothy had not only now become Mrs. John
Hancock, but she was also called <i>Madam</i> Hancock! Oh,
the bliss of the dignified title to its youthful owner! She
read with girlish satisfaction the item in a New York paper
of September 4th, which reported, "Saturday last, the
Honorable John Hancock and his Lady arrived here, and
immediately set out for Philadelphia." With still greater
pleasure a few days later she set herself to the establishing
of a home in that city which was to be her first residence
as a married woman. And well did she carry out her design
to make John Hancock a worthy comrade, for besides
accomplishing all the necessary duties of a housekeeper, she
quickly acquired the dignity and reserve needed for the wife
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of a man filling such a prominent position in the colonies
during the war for Independence. There was much lavish
living and extravagant elegance of dressing, with which she
was obliged to vie, even in the town where the Quakers
were so much in evidence; and meeting, as she did, many
persons of social and political importance, it was impossible
for pretty Dorothy to be as care-free and merry now as she
had been in the days when no heavy responsibilities rested
on her shoulders.</p>

<p>So well did she fill her position as Madam Hancock that
she won golden opinions from the many distinguished men
and women who came together under Hancock's hospitable
roof-tree; her husband noting with ever increasing pride
that his Dolly was more deeply and truly an American
woman in her flowering than ever he could have dreamed
she would become when he fell in love with her on that
Sunday in June. And loyally did he give to her credit for
such inspiration as helped to mold him into the man who
received the greatest honors in the power of the colonists
to bestow.</p>

<p>With the later life of Dorothy Hancock we are not concerned;
our rose had bloomed. It matters not to us that
Madam Hancock was one of the most notable women of
the Revolution, who had known and talked with George
Washington, that she and Martha Washington had actually
discussed their husbands together. To Dorothy's great
pride Mrs. Washington had spoken enthusiastically of Hancock's
high position, while at that time her husband was
but a general. Then, too, pretty Madam Hancock had
known the noble Lafayette&mdash;had met in intimate surroundings
all those great and patriotic men who had devoted
their best endeavors to the establishment of a free and independent
America. All that is no concern of ours in this
brief story of the girl, Dorothy, nor is it ours to mourn with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the mother over the death or her two children, nor ours to
wonder why, three years after the death of her beloved
husband, a man who had made his mark in the history of
his country, she should have married again.</p>

<p>Ours only it is to admire Hancock's Dolly as we see her
in her girlish beauty, as we follow her through the black
days of fear and of tension preceding the outbreak of that
war in which her lover played such a prominent part; ours
to enjoy her charming manner and sparkling wit, and to
respect with deep admiring a brave girl of the Massachusetts
colony who watched a great nation in its birth-throes,
and whose name is written in history not alone as
Madam Hancock, but as Dorothy Quincy, the girl who saw
the first gun fired for Independence.</p>

<p>An inspiration and an example for the girls of to-day,
at a time when all good Americans are united in a firm determination
to make the world safe for democracy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<h2>MOLLY PITCHER: THE BRAVE GUNNER OF THE
BATTLE OF MONMOUTH</h2>


<p>"Oh, but I would like to be a soldier!"</p>

<p>The exclamation did not come from a man or boy
as might have been expected, but from Mary Ludwig, a
young, blue-eyed, freckled, red-haired serving-maid in the
employ of General Irving's family, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
Molly, as they called her, had a decided ability to
do well and quickly whatever she attempted, and her eyes
of Irish blue and her sense of humor must have been handed
down to her somewhere along the line of descent, although
her father, John George Ludwig, was a German who had
come to America with the Palatines.</p>

<p>Having been born in 1754 on a small dairy farm lying
between Princeton and Trenton, New Jersey, Molly's early
life was the usual happy one of a child who lived in the
fields and made comrades of all the animals, especially of
the cows which quite often she milked and drove to pasture.
Like other children of her parentage she was early
taught to work hard, to obey without question, and never
to waste a moment of valuable time. In rain or shine she
was to be found on the farm, digging, or among the live stock,
in her blue-and-white cotton skirt and plain-blue upper garment,
and she was so strong, it was said, that she could
carry a three-bushel bag of wheat on her shoulder to the
upper room of the granary. This strength made her very
helpful in more than one way on the farm, and her parents
objected strongly when she announced her determination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
to leave home and earn her living in a broader sphere of
usefulness, but their objections were without avail.</p>

<p>The wife of General Irving, of French and Indian war
fame, came to Trenton to make a visit. She wished to take
a young girl back to Carlisle with her to assist in the work
of her household, and a friend told her of Molly Ludwig.
At once Mrs. Irving saw and liked the buxom, honest-faced
country girl, and Molly being willing, she was taken back
to the Irvings' home. There she became a much respected
member of the family, as well as a valuable assistant, for
Molly liked to work hard. She could turn her hand to
anything, from fine sewing, which she detested, to scrubbing
floors and scouring pots and pans, which she greatly
enjoyed, being most at home when doing something which
gave her violent exercise. Meals could have been served
off a floor which she had scrubbed, and her knocker and
door-knobs were always in a high state of polish.</p>

<p>But though she liked the housework which fell to her lot,
it was forgotten if by any chance the General began to
talk of his experiences on the battle-field. One day, when
passing a dish of potatoes at the noon meal, the thrilling
account of a young artilleryman's brave deed so stirred
Molly's patriotic spirit that she stood at breathless attention,
the dish of potatoes poised on her hand in mid-air
until the last detail of the story had been told, then with
a prodigious sigh she proclaimed her fervent desire to be a
soldier.</p>

<p>The General's family were not conventional and there
was a hearty laugh at the expense of the serving-maid's
ambition, in which Molly good-naturedly joined. Little
did she dream that in coming days her wish was to be fulfilled,
and her name to be as widely known for deeds of
valor as that of the artilleryman who had so roused her
enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
So wholesome and energetic in appearance was Molly
that she had many admirers, some of them fired with a
degree of practical purpose, beyond their sentimental
avowals. Molly treated them one and all with indifference
except as comrades until John Hays, the handsome young
barber of the town, much sought after by the girls of Carlisle,
began to pay her attention, which was an entirely
different matter. Molly grew serious-minded, moped as
long as it was possible for one of her rollicking nature to
mope&mdash;even lost her appetite temporarily&mdash;then she married
the adoring and ecstatic Hays, and gave her husband
a heart's loyal devotion.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the peaceful Pennsylvania village was stirred
to its quiet center by echoes of the battle of Lexington, and
no other subject was thought of or talked about. All men
with a drop of red blood in their veins were roused to
action, and Hays was no slacker. One morning he spoke
gently to his wife, with intent to hurt her as little as possible.</p>

<p>"I am going, Molly," he said; "I've joined the Continental
army."</p>

<p>Then he waited to see the effect of his words. Although he
knew that his wife was patriotic, he was utterly unprepared
for the response that flamed in her eager eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" she exclaimed; "I am proud to be a
soldier's wife. Count on me to stand by you."</p>

<p>And stand by she did, letting no tears mar the last hours
with him, and waving as cheerful a farewell when he left
her as though he were merely going for a day's pleasuring.
From the firing of the first gun in the cause of freedom her
soul had been filled with patriotic zeal, and now she rejoiced
in honoring her country by cheerfully giving the man she
loved to its service, although she privately echoed her wish
of long ago when she had exclaimed, "Oh, how I wish I
could be a soldier!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Like a brave and sensible young woman, Molly stayed on
with the Irvings, where she scrubbed and scoured and baked
and brewed and spun and washed as vigorously as before,
smiling proudly with no sharp retort when her friends laughingly
predicted that she "had lost her pretty barber, and
would never set eyes on him again." She was too glad to
have him serving his country, and too sure of his devotion,
to be annoyed by any such remarks, and kept quietly on
with her work as though it were her sole interest in life.</p>

<p>Months went by, and hot July blazed its trail of parched
ground and wilted humanity. One morning, as usual,
Molly hung her wash on the lines, then she took a pail
and went to gather blackberries on a near-by hillside. As
she came back later with a full pail, she saw a horseman,
as she afterward said, "riding like lightning up to General
Irving's house." Perhaps he had brought news from her
husband, was her instant thought, and she broke into a
run, for she had received no tidings from him for a long
time, and was eager to know where he was and how he
fared. She had been right in her instinct, the messenger
had brought a letter from John Hays, and it contained great
news indeed, for he wrote:</p>

<p>"When this reaches you, take horse with bearer, who will
go with you to your father's home. I have been to the
farm and seen your parents, who wish you to be with them
now. And if you are there, I shall be able to see you sometimes,
as we are encamped in the vicinity."</p>

<p>Molly might have objected to such a peremptory command,
but the last sentence broke down any resistance she
might have shown. Hastily she told Mrs. Irving of the
letter and its tidings, and although that lady was more than
sorry to lose Molly at such short notice, she not only made
no objections to her departure, but helped her with her
hurried preparations and wished her all possible good fortune.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
In less time than it takes to tell it, Molly had "unpegged
her own clothing from the lines," then seeing they
were still wet, she made the articles into a tight bundle
which she tied to the pommel, the messenger sprang into
the saddle, with Molly behind him, and off they started
from the house which had been Molly's home for so long,
journeying to the farm of her childhood's memories.</p>

<p>Although she missed the kind-hearted Irving family who
had been so good to her, it was a pleasure to be with her
parents again, and Molly put on her rough farm garments once
more, and early and late was out among the cattle, or working
in the fields. And she had a joyful surprise when her
husband paid her a flying visit a few days later. After that,
he came quite frequently, though always unexpectedly, and
if proof was wanting that she was the kind of a wife that
John Hays was proud to have his fellow-soldiers see, it lies
in the fact that he allowed Molly to visit him in camp
more than once. She saw him at Trenton, and at Princeton,
before the Continental army routed the British there,
on January 3, 1777.</p>

<p>In order to surprise the three British regiments which
were at Princeton at that time, General Washington, Commander-in-chief
of the Continental force, quietly left Trenton
with his troops, and crept up behind the unsuspecting
British at Princeton, killing about one hundred men and
taking three hundred prisoners, while his own losses were
only thirty men. Then, anxious to get away before Lord
Cornwallis could arrive with reinforcements for the British,
he slipped away with his men to Morristown, New Jersey,
while the cannon were still booming on the battle-field,
their noise being mistaken in Trenton for thunder. With
the Continental troops went John Hays, gunner, and as soon
as Molly heard of the engagement, and the retirement of
General Washington's troops, she hastened to the field of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
action to seek out any wounded men whom she could care
for or comfort in their last hours. Picking her way across
the littered field, she brought a drink of water here, lifted
an aching head there, and covered the faces of those who
had seen their last battle. As she passed slowly on, she
saw a friend of her husband's, Dilwyn by name, lying half
buried under a pile of debris. She would have passed him
by but for a feeble movement of his hand under the rubbish,
seeing which, she stooped down, pushed aside his covering,
and felt for his pulse to see whether he were still alive.
As she bent down her quick eye saw a cannon near where
the wounded man lay, a heavy, cumbersome gun which the
Continentals had evidently left behind as being of a type
too heavy to drag with them on their hasty march to
Morristown. Beside the cannon Molly also saw a lighted
fuse slowly burning down at one end. She had a temptation
as she looked at the piece of rope soaked in some combustible,
lying there ready to achieve its purpose. She
stooped over Dilwyn again, then she rose and went to
the cannon, fuse in hand. In a half-second the booming of
the great gun shook the battle-field&mdash;Molly had touched it
off, and at exactly the right moment, for even then the advance
guard of Lord Cornwallis and his men was within
range!</p>

<p>At the sound of the cannon they halted abruptly, in alarm.
The foe must be lurking in ambush dangerously near them,
for who else would have set off the gun? They spent an
hour hunting for the concealed Continentals, while Molly
picked Dilwyn up and laid him across her shoulder as she
had carried the wheat-bags in childhood, and coolly walked
past the British, who by that time were swarming across
the battle-field, paying no attention to the red-headed young
woman carrying a wounded soldier off the field, for what
could she have to do with discharging a gun!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Molly meanwhile bore her heavy burden across the fields
for two miles until she reached the farm, where she laid
the wounded man gently down on a bed which was blissfully
soft to his aching bones, and where he was cared for
and nursed as if he had been Molly's own kin. When at
last he was well again and able to ride away from the farm,
he expressed his admiration for his nurse in no measured
terms, and there came to her a few days later a box of fine
dress goods with the warmest regards of "one whose life
you saved." As she looked at the rich material, Molly
smoothed it appreciatively with roughened hand, then she
laid the bundle away among her most cherished possessions,
but making use of it never entered her mind&mdash;it was much
too handsome for that!</p>

<p>Every hour the British troops were delayed at Princeton
was of great advantage to the Continental forces, and by
midnight they had come to the end of their eighteen-mile
march, to their great rejoicing, as it had been a terrible
walk over snow and ice and in such bitter cold that many
a finger and ear were frozen, and all had suffered severely.
The men had not had a meal for twenty-four hours, had
made the long march on top of heavy fighting, and when
they reached their destination they were so exhausted that
the moment they halted they dropped and fell into a heavy
sleep.</p>

<p>While they were marching toward Morristown, Lord
Cornwallis was rushing his troops on to New Brunswick
to save the supplies which the British had stored there.
To his great relief he found them untouched, so he gave up
the pursuit of Washington's fleeing forces, and the Continental
army, without resistance, went into winter quarters
at Morristown, as their Commander had planned to do.
While John Hays, with the American army, was following
his Commander, Molly, at the farm, had become the proud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
mother of a son, who was named John Hays, Jr., and who
became Molly's greatest comfort in the long months when
she had no glimpse or tidings of her husband. Then came
news&mdash;General Washington's troops were again on the
march, passing through New Jersey toward New York.
There would be a chance to see her husband, and Molly
determined to take it, whatever risk or hardship it might
entail, for not only did she long to see Hays, but she could
not wait longer to tell him of the perfections of their son.
And so Molly went to the scene of the battle of Monmouth.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, the 28th of June, 1778, a day which has
come down in history, not only because of the battle which
marks its date, but because of its scorching heat. The mercury
stood near the 100 mark, and man and beast were
well-nigh overcome.</p>

<p>History tells us that the British had remained at Philadelphia
until early in June, when they had evacuated that
city and crossed the Delaware River on June the eighteenth,
with an intention to march across New Jersey to New York.
Having heard of this movement of the British, General
Washington, with a force nearly equal to that of the enemy,
also crossed into New Jersey, with the purpose of retarding
the British march and, if opportunity offered, bring on a
general engagement. By the 22d of June the whole of the
American force was massed on the east bank of the Delaware
in a condition and position to give the enemy battle.
Despite some opposition on the part of General Lee and other
officers, Lafayette and Greene agreed with General Washington
in his opinion that the time to strike had come, and soon
orders were given which led to the battle of Monmouth.</p>

<p>Lafayette was detached with a strong body of troops to
follow up the British rear and act, if occasion presented.
Other riflemen and militia were in advance of him and on
his flanks, making a strong body of picked troops. To
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
protect his twelve-mile baggage-train from these troops, Sir
Henry Clinton placed them with a large escort under
Knyphausen, while he united the rest of his force in the
rear to check the enemy, if they came too close. The distance
between Knyphausen's force and that which brought
up the rear suggested the idea to Washington to concentrate
his assault on the rear force, and to hasten the attack
before the British should reach the high ground of Middletown,
about twelve miles away, where they would be comparatively
safe.</p>

<p>At once General Lee was sent forward to join Lafayette,
with instructions to engage the enemy in such action as was
possible until the remainder of the troops should arrive.
Lee carried out his part of the command in such a half-hearted
way as to bring severe censure on him later, and
when General Greene arrived on the scene of action, Lee
and his men were in retreat.</p>

<p>A sharp reproof from General Washington brought Lee
partially to his senses; he turned about and engaged in a
short, sharp conflict with the enemy, and retired from the
field in good order. At that time Greene's column arrived,
and as a movement of the British threatened Washington's
right wing, he ordered Greene to file off from the road to
Monmouth and, while the rest of the army pushed forward,
to fight his way into the wood at the rear of Monmouth
Court-House. Greene was obeying orders when, foreseeing
that by the flight of Lee Washington would be exposed to
the whole weight of the enemy's attack, he suddenly wheeled
about and took an advantageous position near the British
left wing.</p>

<p>As he hoped, this diverted the enemy's attention from
the fire of the American army. A furious attack followed,
but was met by a cool resistance which was the result of the
army's discipline at Valley Forge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
The artillery of Greene's division, well posted on a commanding
position, was in charge of General Knox, and poured
a most destructive fire on the enemy, seconded by the infantry,
who steadily held their ground. Repeated efforts
of the British only increased their losses.</p>

<p>Colonel Monckton's grenadiers, attempting to drive back
the American forces, were repulsed by General Knox's artillery
with great slaughter. A second attempt was made,
and a third, when Colonel Monckton received his death-blow
and fell from his horse. General Wayne then came
up with a force of farmers, their sleeves rolled up as if harvesting,
and they forced the British back still farther,
leaving the bodies of their wounded and dead comrades on
the field.</p>

<p>Through the long hours of the desperate fighting on that
June day, the mercury rose higher and higher, and many
of the men's tongues were so swollen with the heat that
they could not speak, and they fell exhausted at their posts.
Seeing this, Molly, who was with her husband on the field
of battle, discovered a bubbling spring of water in the
west ravine, and spent her time through the long hours of
blistering heat tramping back and forth carrying water
for the thirsty men, and also for her husband's cannon.
She used for her purpose "the cannon's bucket," which
was a fixture of the gun of that time, and she told afterward
how every time she came back with a brimming bucket
of the sparkling water, the men would call out:</p>

<p>"Here comes Molly with her pitcher!"</p>

<p>As the battle grew fiercer and her trips to the spring became
more frequent, the call was abbreviated into, "Molly
Pitcher!" by which name she was so generally known from
that day that her own name has been almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Higher and higher rose the sun in a cloudless sky, and
up mounted the mercury until the suffering of the soldiers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
in both armies was unspeakable, although the British were
in a worse state than the Americans, because of their woolen
uniforms, knapsacks, and accoutrements, while the Continental
army had no packs and had laid off all unnecessary
clothing. Even so, many of both forces died of prostration,
despite Molly's cooling drinks which she brought to as many
men as possible. John Hays worked his cannon bravely,
while perspiration streamed down his face and heat blurred
his vision. Suddenly all went black before him&mdash;the rammer
dropped from his nerveless hand, and he fell beside
his gun. Quickly to his side Molly darted, put a handkerchief
wet with spring water on his hot brow, laid her head
on his heart to see whether it was still beating. He was
alive! Beckoning to two of his comrades, Molly commanded
them to carry him to the shade of a near-by tree.
And soon she had the satisfaction of seeing a faint smile
flicker over his face as she bent above him. At that moment
her keen ears heard General Knox give a command.</p>

<p>"Remove the cannon!" he said. "We have no gunner
brave enough to fill Hays's place!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Molly, hastening to the General's side and
facing him with a glint of triumph in her blue eyes. "The
cannon shall not be taken away! Since my brave husband
is not able to work it, I will do my best to serve in his
place!"</p>

<p>Picking up the rammer, she began to load and fire with
the courage and decision of a seasoned gunner, standing at
her post through long hours of heat and exhaustion. When
at a late hour the enemy had finally been driven back with
great loss, and Washington saw the uselessness of any renewal
of the assault, General Greene strode over to the place
where Molly Pitcher was still manfully loading the cannon,
and gripped her hand with a hearty:</p>

<p>"I thank you in the name of the American army!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
One can fancy how Molly's heart throbbed with pride
at such commendation, as she picked her way over the
bodies of the dead and wounded to the spot where her husband
was propped up against a tree, slowly recovering from
his prostration, but able to express his admiration for a wife
who had been able to take a gunner's place at a moment's
notice and help to rout the British.</p>

<p>"That night the American army slept upon their arms;
Greene, like his Commander, taking his repose without
couch or pillow, on the naked ground, and with no other
shelter than a tree beneath the broad canopy of heaven.
But this shelter was not sought, nor sleep desired, until
every wounded and hungry soldier had been cared for and
fed with the best food the camp could supply. Rising at dawn,
Washington found the enemy gone! They had stolen silently
away with such rapidity as would, when their flight became
known, put them beyond the chance of pursuit&mdash;and so the
American army had been victorious at Monmouth, and Molly
Pitcher had played an important part in that victory."</p>

<p>She, too, had slept that night under the stars, and when
morning came she was still in the dusty, torn, powder-stained
clothing she had worn as cannonier, and afterward
while working over the wounded. Her predicament was a
bad one when a messenger arrived from General Washington
requesting an interview with her. She, Molly Pitcher,
to be received by the Commander-in-chief of the American
forces in such a garb as that! How could she make herself
presentable for the interview? With her usual quick wit,
Molly borrowed an artilleryman's coat, which in some measure
hid her grimy and torn garments. In this coat over her
own petticoats, and a cocked hat with a feather, doubtless
plucked from a straying hen, she made no further ado, but
presented herself to Washington as requested, and from
the fact that she wore such a costume on that June day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
has come the oft-repeated and untrue story that she wore
a man's clothing on the battle-field.</p>

<p>General Washington's eyes lighted with pleasure at the
sight of such a brave woman, and he received her with
such honor as he would have awarded one of his gallant
men. Molly was almost overcome with his words of praise,
and still more so when he conferred on her the brevet of
Captain, from which came the title, "Captain Molly,"
which she was called by the soldiers from that day. General
Washington also recommended that she be given a
soldier's half-pay for life, as a reward for her faithful performance
of a man's duty at the battle of Monmouth.</p>

<p>That was enough to make John Hays, now completely
recovered from his prostration, the proudest man in the
army; but added to that he had the satisfaction of seeing
Molly given a tremendous ovation by the soldiers, who
cheered her to the echo when they first saw her after that
fateful night. To cap the climax, the great French General
Lafayette showed his appreciation of her courage by asking
Washington if his men "might have the pleasure of giving
Madame a trifle."</p>

<p>Then those French officers who were among the American
regiments formed in two long lines, between which
Captain Molly passed in her artilleryman's coat, cocked
hat in hand, and while lusty cheers rang out, the hat was
filled to overflowing with gold crowns.</p>

<p>And so it was that Molly Pitcher, a country girl of New
Jersey, played a prominent part in the battle of Monmouth
and won for herself an enviable place in American history.</p>

<p>It is of little importance to us that when the war was
over, Molly with her husband and child lived quietly in
Carlisle, John Hays going back to his trade, Molly doing
washing and enjoying her annuity of forty dollars a year
from the government.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
After John Hays's death Molly married again, an Irishman
named McCauley, and it would have been far better
for her to have remained a widow, for her life was unhappy
from that time until her death in 1833, at the age of seventy-nine.</p>

<p>But that does not interest us. Ours it is to admire the
heroic deeds of Molly Pitcher on the battle-field, to thrill
that there was one woman of our country whose achievements
have inspired poets and sculptors in the long years
since she was seen</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">loading, firing that six-pounder,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>when, as a poet has said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tho' like tigers fierce they fought us, to such zeal had Molly brought us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tho' struck with heat and thirsting, yet of drink we felt no lack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There she stood amid the clamor, swiftly handling sponge and rammer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we swept with wrath condign, on their line.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Freehold, New Jersey, at the base of the great Monmouth
battle monument are five bronze tablets, each five
feet high by six in width, commemorating scenes of that
memorable battle. One of these shafts is called the "Molly
Pitcher," and shows Mary Hays using that six-pounder;
her husband lies exhausted at her feet, and General Knox
is seen directing the artillery. Also forty-three years after
her death, on July 4, 1876, the citizens of Cumberland
County, Pennsylvania, placed a handsome slab of Italian
marble over her grave, inscribed with the date of her death
and stating that she was the heroine of Monmouth.</p>

<p>In this, our day, we stand at the place where the old and
the new in civilization and in humanity stand face to face.
Shall the young woman of to-day, with new inspiration,
fresh courage, and desire to better the world by her existence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
face backward or forward in the spirit of patriotism
which animated Molly Pitcher on the battle-field of Monmouth?
Ours "not to reason why," ours "but to do and die,"
not as women, simply, but as citizen-soldiers on a battle-field
where democracy is the golden reward, where in standing
by our guns we stand shoulder to shoulder with the
inspired spirits of the world.</p>

<p>Molly Pitcher stood by her gun in 1778&mdash;our chance has
come in 1917. Let us not falter or fail in expressing the
best in achievement and in womanhood.</p>

<h2>ELIZABETH VAN LEW: THE GIRL WHO RISKED
ALL THAT SLAVERY MIGHT BE ABOLISHED
AND THE UNION PRESERVED</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It was the winter of 1835. Study hour was just over in
one of Philadelphia's most famous "finishing schools"
of that day, and half a dozen girls were still grouped around
the big center-table piling their books up preparatory to
going to their rooms for the night. Suddenly Catherine
Holloway spoke.</p>

<p>"Listen, girls," she said; "Miss Smith says we are to
have a real Debating Club, with officers and regular club
nights, and all sorts of interesting subjects. Won't it be
fun? And what do you suppose the first topic is to be?"</p>

<p>Books were dropped on the table, and several voices exclaimed
in eager question, "What?"</p>

<p>"'Resolved: That Slavery be abolished.' And Betty Van
Lew is to take the negative side!"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of suppressed "Oh-h-hs!" around the
table, then some one asked, "Who is going to take the
other side?"</p>

<p>The speaker shook her head. "I don't know," she said.
"I hope it will be me. My, but it would be exciting to
debate that question against Betty!"</p>

<p>"You would get the worst of it," said a positive voice.
"There isn't a girl in school who knows what she thinks
on any subject as clearly as Betty knows what she believes
about slavery."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
The speaker tossed her head. "You don't know much
about it, if you think that!" she declared. "We Massachusetts
colonists are just as sure on our side as she is on
hers&mdash;and you all ought to be if you are not! Father says
it is only in the cotton-raising States that they think the
way Betty does, and we Northerners must stand firm against
having human beings bought and sold like merchandise. I
just hope I will be chosen on that debate against Betty."</p>

<p>She was, but she came off vanquished by the verbal
gymnastics of her opponent, to whom the arguments in
favor of slavery were as familiar as the principles of arithmetic,
for Betty had heard the subject discussed by eloquent
and interested men ever since she was able to understand
what they were talking about.</p>

<p>Never did two opponents argue with greater fire and
determination for a cause than did those two school-girls,
pitted against each other in a discussion of a subject far
beyond their understanding. So cleverly did the Virginia
girl hold up her end of the debate against her New England
opponent, and so shrewdly did she repeat all the arguments
she had heard fall from Southern lips, that she sat down
amid a burst of applause, having won her case, proudly sure
that from that moment there would be no more argument
against slavery among her schoolmates, for who could
know more about it than the daughter of one of Richmond's
leading inhabitants? And who could appreciate the great
advantages of slavery to the slaves themselves better than
one who owned them?</p>

<p>But Betty had not reckoned with the strength of the feeling
among those Northerners with whose children she was
associated. They had also heard many telling arguments at
home on the side against that which Betty had won because
she had complied so fully with the rules of debate;
and she had by no means won her friends over to her way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of thinking. Many a heated argument was carried on later
in the Quaker City school over that question which was
becoming a matter of serious difference between the North
and the South.</p>

<p>Before the war for Independence slavery existed in all
the States of the Union. After the war was over some of
the States abolished slavery, and others would have followed
their example had it not been for the invention of
the cotton-gin, which made the owning of slaves much
more valuable in the cotton-growing States. East of the
Mississippi River slavery was allowed in the new States
lying south of the Ohio, but forbidden in the territory north
of the Ohio. When Missouri applied for admission into
the Union, the question of slavery west of the Mississippi
was discussed and finally settled by what was afterward
called "The Missouri Compromise of 1820."</p>

<p>In 1818, two years before this Compromise was agreed
upon, Elizabeth Van Lew was born in Richmond. As we
have already seen, when she was seventeen, she was in the
North at school. Doubtless Philadelphia had been chosen
not only because of the excellence of the school to which she
was sent, but also because the Quaker City was her mother's
childhood home, which fact is one to be kept clearly in mind
as one follows Betty Van Lew's later life in all its thrilling
details.</p>

<p>For many months after her victory as a debater Betty's
convictions did not waver&mdash;she was still a firm believer
that slavery was right and best for all. Then she spent a
vacation with a schoolmate who lived in a New England
village, in whose home she heard arguments fully as convincing
in their appeal to her reason as those to which
she had listened at home from earliest childhood. John
Van Lew, Betty's father, had ever been one of those Southerners
who argued that in slavery lay the great protection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for the negro&mdash;in Massachusetts Betty heard impassioned
appeals for the freedom of the individual, of whatever race,
and to those appeals her nature slowly responded as a result
partly of her inheritance from her mother's Northern blood,
and partly as a result of that keen sense of justice which
was always one of her marked traits.</p>

<p>At the end of her school days in the North, Betty's
viewpoint had so completely changed that she went back
to her Richmond home an unwavering abolitionist, who
was to give her all for a cause which became more sacred
to her than possessions or life itself.</p>

<p>Soon after her return to Virginia she was visited by the
New England friend in whose home she had been a guest,
and to the Massachusetts girl, fresh from the rugged hills
and more severe life of New England, Richmond was a
fascinating spot, and the stately old mansion, which John
Van Lew had recently bought, was a revelation of classic
beauty which enchanted her.</p>

<p>The old mansion stood on Church Hill, the highest of
Richmond's seven hills. "Across the way was St. John's,
in the shadow of whose walls Elizabeth Van Lew grew from
childhood. St. John's, which christened her and confirmed
her, and later barred its doors against her." Behind the
house at the foot of the hill stood "The Libby," which in
years to come was to be her special care.... But this is anticipating
our story. Betty Van Lew, full of the charm
and enthusiasm of youth, had just come home from school,
and with her had come the Northern friend, to whom the
Southern city with its languorous beauty and warm hospitality
was a wonder and a delight.</p>

<p>The old mansion stood close to the street, and "from the
pavement two steep, curving flights of stone steps, banistered
by curious old iron railings, ascended to either end of the
square, white-pillared portico which formed the entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to the stately Van Lew home with its impressive hall and
great high-ceilinged rooms. And, oh! the beauty of the
garden at its rear!"</p>

<p>Betty's friend reveled in its depths of tangled color and
fragrance, as arm in arm the girls wandered down broad,
box-bordered walks, from terrace to terrace by way of
moss-grown stone stairs, deep sunk in the grassy lawn, and
now and again the New England girl would exclaim:</p>

<p>"Oh, Betty, I can't breathe, it is all so beautiful!"</p>

<p>And indeed it was. "There were fig-trees, persimmons,
mock orange, and shrubs ablaze with blossoms. The air
was heavy with the sweetness of the magnolias, loud with
the mocking-birds in the thickets, and the drone of insects
in the hot, dry grass. And through the branches of the
trees on the lower terrace one could get frequent glimpses of
the James River, thickly studded with black rocks and tiny
green islands." No wonder that the girl from the bleak
North found it in her heart to thrill at the beauty of such
a gem from Nature's jewel-casket as was that garden of the
Van Lews'!</p>

<p>And other things were as interesting to her in a different
way as the garden was beautiful. Many guests went to and
from the hospitable mansion, and the little Northerner saw
beautiful women and heard brilliant men talk intelligently
on many subjects of vital import, especially on the all-important
subject of slavery; of the men who upheld it,
of its result to the Union. But more interesting to her than
anything else were the slaves themselves, of whom the
Van Lews had many, and who were treated with the kindness
and consideration of children in a family.</p>

<p>"Of course, it is better for them!" declared Betty. "Everybody
who has grown up with them knows that they simply
<i>can't</i> take responsibility,&mdash;and yet!" There was a long
pause, then Betty added, softly: "And yet, all human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
beings have a right to be free; I know it; and all the States
of the Union must agree on that before there is any kind
of a bond between them."</p>

<p>She spoke like an old lady, her arm leaning on the window-sill,
with her dimpled chin resting in her hand, and as the
moonlight gleamed across the window-sill, young as she
was, in Betty Van Lew's face there was a gleam of that purpose
which in coming years was to be her consecration and
her baptism of fire, although a moment later the conversation
of the girls had drifted into more frivolous channels,
and a coming dance was the all-important topic.</p>

<p>As we know, when Missouri applied for admission into
the Union, the slavery question was discussed and finally
settled by the so-called "Missouri Compromise" in 1820.
Now, in 1849, a new question began to agitate both North
and South. Before that time the debate had been as to
the abolishing of slavery, but the question now changed to
"Shall slavery be extended? Shall it be allowed in the
country purchased from Mexico?" As this land had been
made free soil by Mexico, many people in the North insisted
that it should remain free. The South insisted that the
newly acquired country was the common property of the
States, that any citizen might go there with his slaves, and
that Congress had no power to prevent them. Besides
this, the South also insisted that there ought to be as many
slave States as free States. At that time the numbers were
equal&mdash;fifteen slave States and fifteen free. Some threats
were made that the slaveholding States would leave the
Union if Congress sought to shut out slavery in the territory
gained from Mexico.</p>

<p>That a State might secede, or withdraw from the Union,
had long been claimed by a party led by John C. Calhoun,
of South Carolina. Daniel Webster had always opposed this
doctrine and stood as the representative of those who held
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that the Union could not be broken. Now, in 1850, Henry
Clay undertook to end the quarrel between the States, and
as a result there was a famous debate between the most
notable living orators, Webster, Calhoun, and Clay, and a
new compromise was made. It was called the Compromise
of 1850, and it was confidently hoped would be a final
settlement of all the troubles growing out of slavery. But
it was not. With slow and increasing bitterness the feeling
rose in both North and South over the mooted question,
and slowly but surely events moved on toward the
great crisis of 1860, when Abraham Lincoln was elected
President of the United States.</p>

<p>"The Southern States had been hoping that this might be
prevented, for they knew that Lincoln stood firmly for the
abolition of slavery in every State in the Union, and that
he was not a man to compromise or falter when he believed
in a principle. So as soon as he was elected the Southern
States began to withdraw from the Union, known as the
United States of America. First went South Carolina,
then Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
Then delegates from these States met in Montgomery,
Alabama, and formed a new Union which they called the
'Confederate States of America,' with Jefferson Davis as
its President. Then Texas joined the Confederacy, and
events were shaping themselves rapidly for an inevitable
culmination.</p>

<p>"When South Carolina withdrew there was within her
boundary much property belonging to the United States, such
as lighthouses, court-houses, post-offices, custom-houses,
and two important forts, Moultrie and Sumter,
which guarded the entrance to Charleston harbor, and were
held by a small band of United States troops under the
command of Major Robert Anderson.</p>

<p>"As soon as the States seceded a demand was made on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the United States for a surrender of this property. The
partnership called the Union, having been dissolved by the
secession of South Carolina, the land on which the buildings
stood belonged to the State, but the buildings themselves,
being the property of the United States, should be paid for
by the State, and an agent was sent to Washington to arrange
for the purchase.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, scenting grave trouble, troops were being
enlisted and drilled, and Major Anderson, fearing that if
the agent did not succeed in making the purchase the forts
would be taken by force, cut down the flagstaff and spiked
the guns at Fort Moultrie, and moved his men to Fort
Sumter, which stood on an island in the harbor and could
be more easily defended, and so the matter stood when
Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated, March 4, 1861."</p>

<p>Fort Sumter was now in a state of siege. Anderson and
his men could get no food from Charleston, while the troops
of the Confederacy had planted cannon with which they
could at any time fire on the fort. Either the troops must
very soon go away or food must be sent them. Mr. Lincoln
decided to send food. But when the vessels with food,
men and supplies reached Charleston, they found that the
Confederates had already begun to fire on Fort Sumter.
Then, as Major Anderson related: "Having defended the
Fort for thirty-four hours, until the quarters were entirely
burned, the main gates destroyed by fire ... the magazine
surrounded by flame, and its doors closed from the effects
of heat, four barrels and three cartridges only being available,
and no provisions remaining but pork, I accepted terms
of evacuation offered by General Beauregard ... and
marched out of the Fort, Sunday the 14th instant, with
colors flying and drums beating."</p>

<p>When the news of the fall of Sumter reached the North,
the people knew that all hope of a peaceable settlement of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the dispute with the South was gone. Mr. Lincoln at once
called for 75,000 soldiers to serve for three months, and
the first gun of the Civil War had been fired.</p>

<p>While these momentous events were stirring both North
and South, Betty Van Lew, in her Richmond home, was experiencing
the delights of young womanhood in a city celebrated
for its gaiety of social life. "There were balls and
receptions in the great house, garden-parties in the wonderful
garden, journeyings to the White Sulphur Springs, and
other resorts of the day, in the coach drawn by six snowy
horses," and all sorts of festivities for the young and light-hearted.
Even in a city as noted for charming women
as was Richmond, Betty Van Lew enjoyed an enviable
popularity. To be invited to the mansion on the hill was
the great delight of her many acquaintances, while more
than one ardent lover laid his heart at her feet; but her
pleasure was in the many rather than in the one, and she
remained heart-whole while most of her intimate friends
married and went to homes of their own. It is said that as
she grew to womanhood, she was "of delicate physique
and a small but commanding figure, brilliant, accomplished
and resolute, with great personality and of infinite charm."
At first no one took her fearless expression of opinion in
regard to the slavery question seriously, coming as it did
from the lips of such a charming young woman, but as time
went on and she became more outspoken and more diligent
in her efforts to uplift and educate the negroes, she
began to be less popular, and to be spoken of as "queer
and eccentric" by those who did not sympathize with her
views.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Richmond's first families still eagerly accepted
invitations to the Van Lew mansion, and it was in
its big parlor that Edgar Allan Poe read his poem, "The
Raven," to a picked audience of Richmond's elect, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Jenny Lind sang at the height of her fame, and there as a
guest came the Swedish novelist, Fredrika Bremer, and in
later years came Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, whose admiration
of Elizabeth Van Lew was unbounded because of her service
to the Union.</p>

<p>Betty's father having died soon after she came from
school, and her brother John being of a retiring disposition,
Mrs. Van Lew and Betty did the honors of the stately house
on the hill in a manner worthy of Southern society women,
and as years went by and Betty became a woman, always
when they had brilliant guests she listened carefully, saying
little, but was fearlessly frank in her expression of opinion
on vital subjects, when her opinion was asked.</p>

<p>"And now, Sumter had been fired on. Three days after
the little garrison marched out of the smoking fort, Virginia
seceded from the Union, and Richmond went war-mad.
In poured troops from other States, and the beautiful
Southern city became a vast military camp. Daily the
daughters of the Confederacy met in groups to sew or knit
for the soldiers, or to shoot at a mark with unaccustomed
hands. One day a note was delivered at the Van Lew mansion,
and opened by Mrs. Van Lew, who read it aloud to
her daughter:</p>

<p>"'Come and help us make shirts for our soldiers. We
need the immediate assistance of all our women at this
critical time....'"</p>

<p>The silence in the room was unbroken except for the
heart-beats of the two women facing a sure future, looking
sadly into each other's eyes. Suddenly Elizabeth threw
back her head proudly.</p>

<p>"Never!" she said. "Right is right. We must abide
by the consequences of our belief. We will work for the
Union or sit idle!"</p>

<p>The testing of Elizabeth Van Lew had come. Fearlessly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
she made her choice&mdash;fearlessly she took the consequences.
From that moment her story is the story of the Federal
Spy.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>"Out in the middle of the turbulent river James lay Belle
Isle Prison surrounded by its stockade. In the city of
Richmond, at the foot of Church Street, almost at Betty
Van Lew's door, was the Libby, with its grim, gray walls;
only a stone's throw farther away were Castle Lightning
on the north side of Cary Street, and Castle Thunder on the
south side. In July of 1861 the battle of Bull Run was
fought, and the Confederate army defeated and put to
flight by the Union soldiers. The Libby, Belle Isle and
Castle Thunder all were overflowing with scarred and suffering
human beings,&mdash;with sick men, wounded men, dying
men, and Northern prisoners." Here was work to do!</p>

<p>Down the aisles of the hastily converted hospitals and
into dim prison cells came almost daily a little woman with
a big smile, always with her hands full of flowers or delicacies,
a basket swinging from her arm. As she walked
she hummed tuneless airs, and her expression was such a
dazed and meaningless one that the prison guards and other
soldiers paid little heed to the coming and going of "Crazy
Bet," as she was called. "Mis' Van Lew&mdash;poor creature,
she's lost her balance since the war broke out. She'll do
no harm to the poor boys, and maybe a bit of comfortin'. A
permit? Oh yes, signed by General Winder himself,&mdash;let
her be!" Such was the verdict passed from sentry-guard
to sentry in regard to "Crazy Bet," who wandered on at
will, humming her ditties and ministering to whom she
would.</p>

<p>One day a cautious guard noticed a strange dish she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
carried into the prison. It was an old French platter, with
double bottom, in which water was supposed to be placed
to keep the food on the platter hot. The dish roused the
guard's suspicions, and to a near-by soldier he muttered
something about it. Apparently unheeding him, "Crazy
Bet" passed on beyond the grim, gray walls, carrying her
platter, but she had heard his words. Two days later she
came to the prison door again with the strange dish in her
hand wrapped in a shawl. The sentry on guard stopped her.</p>

<p>"I will have to examine that," he said.</p>

<p>"Take it!" she said, hastily unwrapping it and dropping
it into his hands. It contained no secret message that
day, as it had before&mdash;only water scalding hot, and the
guard dropped it with a howl of pain, and turned away
to nurse his burned hands, while "Crazy Bet" went into
the prison smiling a broad and meaningless smile.</p>

<p>Well did the Spy play her r&ocirc;le, as months went by;
more loudly she hummed, more vacantly she smiled, and
more diligently she worked to obtain information regarding
the number and placing of Confederate troops, which information
she sent on at once to Federal headquarters.
Day by day she worked, daring loss of life, and spending her
entire fortune for the sake of the cause which was dearer
to her than a good name or riches&mdash;the preservation of the
Union and the abolishing of slavery.</p>

<p>From the windows of the Libby, and from Belle Isle, the
prisoners could see passing troops and supply-trains and
give shrewd guesses at their strength and destination,
making their conjectures from the roads by which they saw
the Confederates leave the town. Also they often heard
scraps of conversations between surgeons or prison guards,
which they hoarded like so much gold, to pass on to "Crazy
Bet," and so repay her kindness and her lavish generosity,
which was as sincere as her underlying motive was genuine.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Meals at the Van Lew mansion grew less and less bountiful,
even meager,&mdash;not one article did either Elizabeth Van
Lew or her loyal mother buy for themselves, but spent their
ample fortune without stint on the sick and imprisoned
in their city, while there was never an hour of her time that
the Federal Spy gave to her own concerns. If there was
nothing else to be done, she was writing a home letter for
some heart-sick prisoner from the North, and secretly carrying
it past the censors to be sure that it should reach the
anxious family eagerly awaiting news of a loved one.</p>

<p>"Crazy Bet" loaned many books to the prisoners, which
were returned with a word or sentence or a page number
faintly underlined here and there. In the privacy of her
own room, the Spy would piece them together and read some
important bit of news which she instantly sent to Federal
headquarters by special messenger, as she had ceased using
the mails in the early stages of the war. Or a friendly little
note would be handed her with its hidden meaning impossible
to decipher except by one who knew the code. Important
messages were carried back and forth in her baskets
of fruit and flowers in a way that would have been dangerous
had not "Crazy Bet" established such a reputation for
harmless kindness. She had even won over Lieutenant
Todd, brother of Mrs. Lincoln, who was in charge of the
Libby, by the personal offerings she brought him of delectable
buttermilk and gingerbread. Clever Bet!</p>

<p>So well did she play her part now, and with such assurance,
that she would sometimes stop a stranger on the
street and begin a heated argument in favor of the Union,
while the person who did not know her looked on the outspoken
little woman with a mixture of admiration and contempt.
At that time her lifelong persecution, by those
who had before been her loyal friends, began. Where before
she had been met with friendly bows and smiles, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
were now averted glances or open insults. She encountered
dislike, even hatred, on every side, but at that time it mattered
little to her, for her heart and mind were occupied
with bigger problems.</p>

<p>What she did mind was that from time to time her permit
to visit the hospitals and prisons was taken away, and
she was obliged to use all the diplomacy of which she was
mistress, to win it back again from either General Winder
or the Secretary of War. At one time the press and people
became so incensed against the Northern prisoners that
no one was allowed to visit the prisons or do anything for
their relief. Among the clippings found among Betty Van
Lew's papers is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rapped Over the Knucks.</span></p>

<p>One of the city papers contained Monday a word of exhortation to certain
females of Southern residence (and perhaps birth) but of decidedly
Northern and Abolition proclivities. The creatures thus alluded to were
not named.... If such people do not wish to be exposed and dealt
with as alien enemies to the country, they would do well to cut stick
while they can do so with safety to their worthless carcasses.</p>
</div>

<p>On the margin in faded ink there is written: "These
ladies were my mother and myself. God knows it was but
little we could do."</p>

<p>Spring came, and McClellan, at the head of the Army
of the Potomac, moved up the peninsula. "On to Richmond!"
was the cry, as the troops swept by. It is said that
the houses in the city shook with the cannonading, and
from their roofs the people could see the bursting of shells.
"Crazy Bet," watching the battle with alternate hope and
fear, was filled with fierce exultation, and hastily prepared a
room in the house on the hill with new matting and fresh
curtains for the use of General McClellan. But the Federal
forces were repulsed by the Confederate troops under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
General Lee and "drew away over the hills." General McClellan
had failed in his attempt to take Richmond, and within
that room freshly prepared for his use bitter disappointment
and dead hope were locked.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in Richmond in this repulse
of the Federal army, and even those old friends who were
now enemies of Elizabeth Van Lew, could afford to throw
her a smile or a kind word in the flush of their triumph.
She responded pleasantly, for she was a big enough woman
to understand a viewpoint which differed from her own.
Meanwhile, she worked on tirelessly through the long days
and nights of an unusually hot summer, meeting in secret
conferences with Richmond's handful of Unionists, to plot
and scheme for the aid of the Federal authorities. "The Van
Lew mansion was the fifth in a chain of Union Secret Service
relaying stations, whose beginning was in the headquarters
tent of the Federal army. Of this chain of stations
the Van Lew farm, lying a short distance outside of
the city, was one. It was seldom difficult for Betty Van
Lew to get passes for her servants to make the trip between
the farm and the Richmond house, and this was one of her
most valuable methods of transmitting and receiving secret
messages. Fresh eggs were brought in from the farm almost
every day to the house on Church Hill, and no one was allowed
to touch them until the head of the house had counted
them, with true war-time economy, and she always took
one out, for her own use in egg-nog, so she said. In reality
that egg was but a shell which contained a tiny scroll of
paper, a message from some Union general to the Federal
Spy. An old negro brought the farm products in to Richmond,
and he always stopped for a friendly chat with his
mistress, yes, and took off his thick-soled shoes that he
might deliver into her hands a cipher despatch which she
was generally awaiting eagerly! Much sewing was done
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
for the Van Lews at that time by a little seamstress, who
worked at both farm and city home, and in carrying dress
goods and patterns back and forth she secreted much
valuable information for the Spy, on whom the Union generals
were now depending for the largest part of their news
in regard to Confederate plans and movements of troops."
And she did not disappoint them in the slightest detail.</p>

<p>She must have a disguise in which she could go about the
city and its environs without fear of detection, and she
must also gain more valuable and accurate information from
headquarters of the Confederacy. This she resolved, and
then set to work to achieve her end. At once she wrote to
a negro girl, Mary Elizabeth Bowser, who had been one of
the Van Lews' slaves, but who had been freed and sent
North to be educated, inviting her to visit the stately mansion
where she had grown up, and the invitation was eagerly
accepted. On her arrival in Richmond, she was closeted
a long time with her one-time mistress, to whom she owed
her liberty, and when the interview ended the girl's eyes
were shining, and she wore an air of fixed resolve only
equaled by that of Betty Van Lew.</p>

<p>A waitress was needed in the White House of the Southern
Confederacy. Three days after Mary Bowser arrived at
the Van Lews', she had applied for the position and become
a member of Jefferson Davis's household. Another link
had been forged in the long chain of details by which the
Spy worked her will and gained her ends.</p>

<p>Despite the suspicion and ill-will felt in Richmond for
the Van Lews, more than one Confederate officer and public
official continued to call there throughout the war, to be
entertained by them. The fare was meager in comparison
to the old lavish entertaining, but the conversation was brilliant
and diverting, and so cleverly did Betty lead it that
"many a young officer unwittingly revealed much important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
information of which he never realized the value, but
which was of great use to 'Crazy Bet' when combined
with what she already knew.</p>

<p>"And when night fell over the city Betty would steal out
in her disguise of a farm-hand, in the buckskin leggins, one-piece
skirt and waist of cotton, and the huge calico sunbonnet,
going about her secret business, a little lonely, unnoticed
figure, and in a thousand unsuspected, simple ways
she executed her plans and found out such things as she
needed to know to aid the Federal authorities."</p>

<p>History was in the making in those stirring days of
1862, when, having failed to take Richmond, General
McClellan had returned North by sea, when the Confederates
under General Lee prepared to invade the North, but
were turned back after the great battle of Antietam. Thrilling
days they were to live through, and to the urge and
constant demand for service every man and woman of
North and South instantly responded. But none of the
women gave such daring service as did Elizabeth Van Lew.
Known as a dauntless advocate of abolition and of the
Union, suspected of a traitor's disloyalty to the South, but
with that stain on her reputation as a Southerner unproved
from the commencement of the war until its close, her life
was in continual danger. She wrote a year later, "I was
an enthusiast who never counted it dear if I could have
served the Union&mdash;not that I wished to die." For four
long years she awoke morning after morning to a new day
of suspense and threatening danger, to nights of tension and
of horrible fear. "No soldier but had his days and weeks
of absolute safety. For her there was not one hour; betrayal,
friends' blunders, the carelessness of others; all
these she had to dread." All these she accepted for the
sake of a cause which she believed to be right and just.</p>

<p>As her system of obtaining information in regard to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
movements of the Confederates became more perfect, she was
connected more closely with the highest Federal authorities,&mdash;so
closely connected, in fact, that flowers which one day
grew in her Richmond garden stood next morning on General
Grant's breakfast table.</p>

<p>"One day she received a letter from General Butler, which
was to be delivered to a Confederate officer on General
Winder's staff. In the letter this officer was asked to
'come through the lines and tell what he knew,' and there
were promises of rewards if it should be done successfully.
The Spy sat quietly thinking for some time after receiving
this letter. If it should fall into Confederate hands it
would be the death-warrant of its bearer. Who could be
trusted to take it to the officer for whom it was intended?
Coolly Elizabeth Van Lew arose, went out, and walked
straight to the office of General Winder, took the letter from
her bosom, and handed it to the officer for whom it was
intended, watching him closely as he read it.</p>

<p>"In the next room were detectives and armed guards, the
whole machinery of the Confederate capital's secret police.
The officer had but to raise his voice and her game would
be up; she would pay the penalty of her daring with her
life. She had been suspicious of the officer for some weeks,
had marked him as a traitor to his cause. Was she right?</p>

<p>"His face whitened, his lips were set as he read, then,
without a quiver of a muscle, he rose and followed her out
of the room; then he gave way and implored her to be
more prudent. If she would never come there again he
would go to her, he said. And so she gained another aid in
her determined purpose of 'striking at the very heart of
the Confederacy.'</p>

<p>"Another day there was a message of vital importance to
send to General Grant, who had asked her to make a report
to him of the number and placing of forces in and about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Richmond. The cipher despatch was ready, but if it were
to reach Grant in time there was not an hour to lose in
finding a messenger. At that time no servant of hers could
leave the city, and no Federal agent could enter it. Hoping
for an inspiration, she took her huge market-basket on her
arm, the basket which was so familiar by this time as a
part of 'Crazy Bet's' outfit, and with it swinging at her
side, humming a tuneless song, she passed down the street,
smiling aimlessly in return for mocking glances&mdash;and all
the while in her hand she held the key to Richmond's
defenses!</p>

<p>"As she walked a man passed her and whispered, 'I'm
going through to-night!' then walked on just ahead of
her. She gave no sign of eagerness, but she was thinking:
Was he a Federal agent to whom she could intrust her
message, or was he sent out by the police to entrap her as
had often been attempted? The cipher despatch in her
hand was torn into strips, each one rolled into a tiny ball.
Should she begin to drop them, one by one? In perplexity
she glanced up into the man's face. No! Her woman's
instinct spoke loud and clear, made her turn into a side
street and hurry home. The next day she saw him marching
past her house for the front with his Confederate regiment,
in the uniform of a junior officer, and knew that once
again she had been saved from death."</p>

<p>But although she had many such escapes and her wit
was so keen that it was a powerful weapon in any emergency,
yet as the conflict between the North and the South
deepened the need of caution became more necessary than
ever, for Confederate spies were everywhere. In her half-destroyed
diary which for many months lay buried near
the Van Lew house, over and over again the writer emphasizes
her fear of discovery. She says:</p>

<p>"If you spoke in your parlor or chamber, you whispered,&mdash;you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
looked under the lounges and beds. Visitors apparently
friendly were treacherous.... Unionists lived ever in
a reign of terror. I was afraid even to pass the prison; I
have had occasion to stop near it when I dared not look up
at the windows. I have turned to speak to a friend and
found a detective at my elbow. Strange faces could sometimes
be seen peeping around the columns and pillars of the
back portico.... Once I went to Jefferson Davis himself to
see if we could not obtain some protection.... His private
Secretary told me I had better apply to the Mayor....
Captain George Gibbs had succeeded Todd as keeper of the
prisoners; so perilous had our situation become that we
took him and his family to board with us. They were certainly
a great protection.... Such was our life&mdash;such was
freedom in the Confederacy. I speak what I know." The
diary also tells of Mrs. Van Lew's increasing dread of arrest,
dear, delicate, loyal lady&mdash;for that was constantly
spoken of, and reported on the street, while some never
hesitated to say she should be hanged.</p>

<p>Another summer came and wore away, and the third year
of the war was drawing to a close in the terrible winter of
1863-4. The Union army in the East had twice advanced
against the Confederates, to be beaten back at Fredericksburg
and at Chancellorsville. In June and July of 1863
Lee began a second invasion of the North, but was defeated
at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In July, 1863, Vicksburg and
Port Hudson were captured and the Mississippi River was
in Union hands, but in the following autumn the Confederates
of the West defeated the Union army at Chickamauga,
after which General Grant took command and was
victorious near Chattanooga, and so with alternate hope
and despair on both sides the hideous war went on.</p>

<p>Through cipher despatches "Crazy Bet" learned of an
intended attempt of Federal officers to escape from Libby
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Prison, and at once a room in the Van Lew mansion was
made ready to secrete them if they achieved their purpose.
The room was at the end of one of the big parlors,
and dark blankets were hung over its windows; beds were
made ready for exhausted occupants, and a low light kept
burning day and night in readiness for their possible arrival.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prisoners in the Libby, desperate because
of the horrible conditions in the buildings where they were
quartered, were busily constructing a tunnel which ran from
the back part of the cellar called "Rat-Hell" to the prison
yard. The work was carried on under the direction of
Colonel Rose, and his frenzied assistants worked like demons,
determined to cut their way through the walls of that grim
prison to the light and life of the outer world. At last the
tunnel was ready. With quivering excitement over their
great adventure added to their exhaustion, the men who
were to make their escape, one after another disappeared
in the carefully guarded hole leading from the cellar of the
prison into a great sewer, and thence into the prison yard.
Of this little company of adventurous men eleven Colonels,
seven Majors, thirty-two Captains, and fifty-nine Lieutenants
escaped before the daring raid was discovered. The
news spread like wild-fire through the ranks of the prisoners
who were still in the building and among those on duty.
Immediately every effort was made by those in charge to
re-capture the refugees and bring them back, and as a
result, between fifty and sixty of them were once again
imprisoned in the squalid cells of the Libby.</p>

<p>Just at that time John Van Lew, Betty's brother, was
conscripted into the Confederate army, and although unfit
for military duty because of his delicate health, he was at
once sent to Camp Lee. As he was a keen sympathizer
with his sister's Union interests, as soon as he was sent to
the Confederate camp he deserted and fled to the home of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
family who lived on the outskirts of the city, who were both
Union sympathizers and friends of his sister's. They hid
him carefully, and Betty at once came to aid in planning
for his escape from the city. Unfortunately it was the
night of the escape of the Federal prisoners from the Libby,
so a doubly strong guard was set over every exit from
Richmond, making escape impossible. Here was a difficult
situation! Betty Van Lew knew that some way out of the
dilemma must be found; for the house where her brother
was secreted would surely be searched for the escaped
refugees, and it would go hard with those who were concealing
him if they were discovered harboring a deserter.</p>

<p>With quick wit she immediately presented herself at
General Winder's office, where she used her diplomatic
powers so successfully that the general was entirely convinced
of John Van Lew's unfit physical condition for military
service, and promised to make every effort toward his
exemption. When all efforts proved unavailing, the general
took him into his own regiment, and "the Union sympathizer
never wore a Confederate uniform, and only once
shouldered a Confederate musket, when on a great panic
day he stood, a figurehead guard at the door of a government
department. At last, in 1864, when even General
Winder could not longer protect him from active service
at the front, Van Lew deserted again, and served with the
Federal Army until after the fall of Richmond."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old Van Lew house, in its capacity of
Secret Service station, was a hive of industry, which was
carried on with such smooth and silent secrecy that no one
knew what went on in its great rooms. And watching
over all those who came and went on legitimate business,
or as agents of the Federal Government on secret missions,
was a woman, alert of body, keen of mind, standing at her
post by day and by night. After all members of her household
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
were safely locked in their rooms for the night, the
Spy would creep down, barefooted, to the big library with
its ornamented iron fireplace. On either side of this fireplace
were two columns, on each of which was a small, carved
figure of a lion. Possibly by accident&mdash;probably by design,
one of these figures was loosened so that it could be
raised like a box-lid, and in the darkness of the night the
swift, silent figure of the Spy would steal into the big room,
lift the carved lion, deftly slip a message in cipher into the
cavity beneath the figure and cautiously creep away, with
never a creaking board to reveal her coming or going.</p>

<p>With equal caution and swift dexterity, early the next
morning an old negro servant would steal into the room,
duster and broom in hand, to do his cleaning. Into every
corner of the room he would peer, to be sure there were no
watching eyes, then he would slip over to the fireplace, lift
the lion, draw out the cipher message, place it sometimes in
his mouth, sometimes in his shoe, and as soon as his morning
chores were done he would be seen plodding down the
dusty road leading to the farm, where some one was eagerly
waiting for the tidings he carried. Well had the Spy
trained her messengers!</p>

<p>The old mansion had also hidden protection for larger
bodies than could be concealed under the recumbent lion
by the fireplace. Up under the sloping roof, between the
west wall of the garret and the tiles, was a long, narrow
room, which was probably built at the order of Betty Van
Lew, that she might have a safe shelter for Union refugees.
All through the war gossip was rife concerning the Van
Lews and their movements, and there were many rumors
that the old mansion had a secret hiding-place, but this
could never be proved. Besides those whom it sheltered from
time to time, and the one whose thought had planned it,
only one other person knew of the existence of that garret
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
room, and for long years she was too frightened to tell what
she had seen in an unexpected moment.</p>

<p>Betty Van Lew's niece was visiting in the old house during
the blackest period of the struggle between the North
and South. She was a little girl, and her bump of curiosity
was well developed. After tossing restlessly in bed on a
hot night, she opened her door in order to get some air.
To her surprise she saw Aunt Betty tiptoeing through the
other end of the dark hall, carrying something in her hand.
With equal stealth the curious child followed the creeping
figure up through the dark, silent house into the garret&mdash;saw
a hand reach behind an old chest of drawers standing
against the wall in the garret, and with utter amaze saw
a black hole in the wall yawn before her eyes. There stood
her aunt before the opening of the wall, shading with cautious
hand the candle she carried, while facing her stood
a gaunt, hollow-eyed, bearded man in uniform reaching out
a greedy hand for the food on the plate. The man saw the
child's eyes burning through the darkness back of the older
woman, but she put a chubby finger on her lip, and ran
away before he had a chance to realize that she was flesh
and blood and not an apparition. Panting, she ran swiftly
down the long staircase and, with her heart beating fast
from fright, flung herself on the bed and buried her head
in the pillows, lying there for a long time, so it seemed to
her. Then, scarcely daring to breathe, for fear of being discovered,
she stole out of bed again, opened her door, and
once more crept up through the silent mansion, this time
alone. In a moment she stood outside the place where the
hole in the wall had opened before her amazed vision. Not
a sound in the great, dark garret! Putting her mouth close
to the partition she called softly to the soldier, and presently
a deep voice told her how to press the spring and open the
secret door. Then, a shivering but determined little white-robed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
figure, she stood before the yawning chasm and
talked with the big, Union soldier, who seemed delighted
at the sound of his own voice, and years afterward she remembered
how he had looked as he said:</p>

<p>"My! what a spanking you would have got if your aunt
had turned around!" She did not dare to stand there
talking to him long, for she was old enough to realize that
there must be a reason for his being in hiding, and that if
the secret room should be discovered it might bring unhappiness
to her aunt. So in a very few moments the little
white-gowned figure flitted silently, swiftly down-stairs
again, and no one knew until years later of that midnight
excursion of hers&mdash;or of the secret room, for which the old
house was thoroughly searched more than once.</p>

<p>The winter of 1863-4 was one full of tense situations
and of many alarms for both Confederates and Unionists.
In February, after the daring escape of the Federal officers
from the Libby, there were several alarms, which roused
young and old to the defense of the city. The enemy made
a movement to attack the city on the east side, but were
driven back. Again on the 29th of the month, the bells
all rang to call men to service. The city battalions responded,
while General Wilcox ordered all men who were
in the city on furlough, and all who could bear arms, out
to protect the city, for Kilpatrick was attempting a raid on
Richmond, along Brook turnpike. "But while he was
dreaming of taking Richmond, Gen. Wade Hampton suddenly
appeared with his troops and routed him, taking
three hundred and fifty prisoners, killing and wounding
many, and capturing a large number of horses."</p>

<p>Then came an event for which the Federal sympathizers,
and especially those in the Union Secret Service, had prepared
with all the caution and secrecy possible, trying to
perfect every detail to such a degree that failure would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
impossible. To release all Federal prisoners in Richmond&mdash;this
was but a part of the audacious scheme in which Betty
Van Lew and a Union sympathizer called "Quaker," for
purposes of disguise, played an important part.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February, 1864, Col. Ulric Dahlgren left
Stevensburg with a company of men, selected from brigades
and regiments, as a picked command to attempt a
desperate undertaking. At Hanovertown he crossed with
his men, all dressed in Confederate uniforms, confidently
expecting to get into Richmond by stealth. Unfortunately
their movements were discovered, and when they rode along
through the woods near the road at Old Church, in their disguise,
a party of Confederates in ambush opened fire on
them, captured ninety white men and thirty-five negroes,
and killed poor little crippled Dahlgren, a small, pale young
officer, who "rode with crutches strapped to his saddle,
and with an artificial leg in the stirrup, as he had lost a
limb a few months before. His death was as patriotic as
was his desperate attempt, for bravely his eager band rode
into the ambush&mdash;there was a volley of shots from the
thicket by the roadside, and the young colonel fell from
his horse, dead. Some of his men managed to escape, but
most of them were captured."</p>

<p>In Dahlgren's pocket was found an order to all of his
men and officers. To the officers he said:</p>

<p>"We will have a desperate fight, but stand up to it.
When it does come, all will be well. We hope to release the
prisoners from Belle Isle first, and having seen them fairly
well started, we will cross James River into Richmond, destroying
the bridges after us, and exhorting the released
prisoners to destroy and burn the hateful city, and do not
allow the rebel leader Davis and his traitorous crew to
escape."</p>

<p>To his guides and runners he said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
"Be prepared with oakum, turpentine, and torpedoes.
Destroy everything that can be used by the rebels. Shoot
horses and cattle, destroy the railroads and the canal, burn
the city, leave only the hospitals, and kill Jeff Davis and
his Cabinet."</p>

<p>A dangerous plan indeed! Small wonder that when its
details became known in their diabolical cruelty, the people
of Richmond cried out for revenge, and the hanging of the
prisoners; but this was not heeded by the officials, who had
a saner judgment.</p>

<p>The raid had failed! Ulric Dahlgren had lost his life in
a daring attempt to which he was evidently urged by Betty
Van Lew and the so-called Quaker. Bit by bit the reasons
for its failure filtered through to the Spy, chief of which
was the treachery of Dahlgren's guide, by which the forces
of the raiders, after separating in two parts for the attack,
lost each other and were never able to unite. The brave, crippled
young commander riding fearlessly on to within
five miles of the city into the ambush, his command falling
under the volley of shots from a hidden enemy&mdash;when these
details reached Betty Van Lew her anguish was unbearable,
for she had counted on success instead of failure. And now,
there was work to do! Pacing the floor, she made her plans,
and with swift daring carried them out.</p>

<p>Dahlgren was buried on the very spot where he fell; but
a few days later the body was taken to Richmond by
order of the Confederate government, where it lay for some
hours at the York River railroad station. Then, at midnight,
it was taken away by the city officials and buried,
no one knew where. But Betty Van Lew says in her diary:
"The heart of every Unionist was stirred to its depths ...
and to discover the hidden grave and remove his honored
dust to friendly care was decided upon."</p>

<p>Admiral Dahlgren, father of the unfortunate colonel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
sent one hundred dollars in gold to Jefferson Davis, asking
that the body of his son be sent to him. The order was
at once given to the chief of police, with the added command
to have the body placed in a decent coffin; but when
the police went to carry out the order, taking with them
the soldiers who had buried Dahlgren, the grave was empty!</p>

<p>Through the daring act of Secret Service agents, doubtless,
and of Betty Van Lew's assistants, on a bitter cold and
stormy night, two Union sympathizers went out to the
grave, the location of which had been cleverly discovered
by the Unionists. The body of young Dahlgren was quickly
taken up and carried to a work-shop belonging to Mr.
William Rowley, who lived a short distance in the country.
He watched over the remains all night, and during the
hours of darkness more than one Union sympathizer stole out
to the shop to pay their last respects to the pathetic young
victim of the attempted raid. At dawn the body was placed
in a metallic coffin and put on a wagon, under a load of young
peach-trees, which entirely concealed the casket. Then
Mr. Rowley, who was a man of iron nerves and great courage,
jumped to the driver's seat and bravely drove the
wagon with its precious freight out of Richmond, past the
pickets, without the visible trembling of an eye-lash to
betray his dangerous mission.</p>

<p>"As he had feared, at the last picket post, he was stopped
and challenged. His wagon must be searched. Was his
brave hazard lost? As he waited for the search to be
made which would sign his death warrant, one of the guards
recognized him as an old acquaintance, and began a lively
conversation with him. Other wagons came up, were
searched, and went on. Presently the Lieutenant came
from his tent and called to the guard to 'Search that man
and let him go!'</p>

<p>"The guard looked with interest at the well-packed load,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and remarked that it would be a shame to tear up those
trees.</p>

<p>"Rowley gave no sign of fear or nervousness. Nonchalantly
he said that he had not expected them to be disturbed,
but that he knew a soldier's duty.</p>

<p>"Another wagon drove up, was searched, and sent on.
Again the Lieutenant gave an order to 'search the man
so that he can go!' Could anything save him now? Rowley
wondered. If he had not been a born actor he would
have shown some sign of the terrible strain he was under
as he waited for the discovery of his hidden burden.</p>

<p>"A moment of agonizing suspense, then the guard said, in
a low voice, 'Go on!' and Rowley, without search, went on
with his concealed burden.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, two accomplices had flanked the picket, and
they presently joined Rowley and showed him the way to
a farm not far away, where a grave was hastily dug and the
coffin lowered into it. Two loyal women helped to fill it
in, and planted over it one of the peach-trees which had so
successfully prevented discovery. So ended the Dahlgren
raid&mdash;and so the Spy had been foiled in one of the most
daring and colossal plots with which she was connected.
Because of the stealing of the young Colonel's body, Admiral
Dahlgren's wish could not be complied with until
after the war."</p>

<p>The raid had failed, and with the return of spring, the
Union Army was closing in around Richmond, which made
it an easier matter for Betty Van Lew to communicate
with the Union generals, especially with General Grant,
through his Chief of Secret Service. As the weary months
wore away, more than once the Spy was in an agony of suspense,
when it seemed as if some one of her plots was about
to bring a revelation of her secret activities; as if disclosure
by some traitor was inevitable; but in every case she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
saved from danger, and was able to continue her work for
the Union.</p>

<p>And now the Confederate forces were ransacking the
South in search of horses, of which they were sorely in need.
The Spy quickly hid her one remaining animal in the
smoke-house, but it was not safe there. Confederate
agents were prowling about the city, searching every building
in which a horse could be secreted. In the dead of night
Betty Van Lew led her steed, with feet wrapped in cloths
to prevent noise, from the smoke-house into the old mansion
itself, and stabled it in the study, where she had covered
the floor with a thick layer of straw to deaden any
sound of stamping hoofs. And the horse in his palatial
residence was not discovered.</p>

<p>General Grant was now at the head of all the armies
of the United States, and to him was given the duty of attacking
Lee. General Sherman was at the head of a large
force in the West, and his duty was to crush the force of
General Johnston.</p>

<p>On the fourth of May, 1864, each general began his task.
Sherman attacked Johnston, and step by step drove him
through the mountains to Atlanta, where Johnston was removed,
and his army from that time was led by General
Hood. After trying in vain to beat Sherman, he turned
and started toward Tennessee, hoping to draw Sherman
after him. But he did not succeed; Sherman sent Thomas,
the "Rock of Chickamauga," to deal with Hood, and in
December he destroyed Hood's army in a terrible battle
at Nashville. Meanwhile Sherman started to march from
Atlanta to the sea, his army advancing in four columns,
covering a stretch of country miles wide. They tore up
the railroads, destroyed the bridges, and finally occupied
Savannah. There Sherman stayed for a month, during
which his soldiers became impatient. Whenever he passed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
them they would shout: "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is
waiting for us in Richmond!" And on the first of February
they resumed their march to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Grant, meanwhile, had begun his attack on Lee, on the
same day that Sherman had marched against Johnston.
Starting from a place called Culpepper Court House, Grant's
army entered the Wilderness, a tract of country covered
with a dense growth of oak and pine, and after much hard
fighting closed in around Richmond, laying siege to Petersburg.
Bravely Lee and his gallant men resisted the Union
forces until April, 1865, when, foreseeing the tragic end
ahead, Lee left Richmond and marched westward. Grant
followed, and on the ninth of April Lee surrendered his
army at Appomattox Court House. Johnston surrendered
to Sherman near Raleigh, in North Carolina, about two
weeks later, and in May Jefferson Davis was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>This ended the war. The Confederacy fell to pieces, and
the Union was saved. "In the hearts of all Union sympathizers
was a passionate exultation that the United States
was once again under one government; but what a day of
sorrowing was that for loyal Southerners!"</p>

<p>It is said that on Sunday, the second of April, when the
end was in sight, children took their places in the Sunday
Schools, and congregations gathered as usual in the churches,
united in their fervent prayers for their country and their
soldiers. The worshipping congregation of St. Paul's
Church was disturbed by the sight of a messenger who
walked up the middle aisle to the pew where Jefferson
Davis was sitting, spoke hastily to him, then went briskly
out of the church. What could it mean?</p>

<p>"Ah!" says an historian, "the most sadly memorable day
in Richmond's history was at hand ... the day which for
four long years had hung over the city like a dreadful nightmare
had come at last. The message had come from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
General Lee of the order to evacuate Richmond! Beautiful
Richmond to be evacuated! It was like the knell of doom.</p>

<p>"President Davis and the other officers of the Confederate
government hastily prepared to leave, and to carry such
records and stores as they were able. The officers of the
State government and the soldiers were preparing to march.
The news of the evacuation swept over the city, spreading
dismay and doom as it went. The people began to collect
their valuables and hide them or pack them to carry to a
place of safety, if any such place could be found; and
throughout the city there were scenes of indescribable confusion.
The streets were blocked with furniture and other
goods which people were trying to move. All government
store-houses were thrown open, and what could not be carried
away was left to be plundered by those who rushed
in to get bacon, clothing, or whatever they could take.
The Confederate troops were rapidly moving toward the
South.... At one o'clock it became known that under the
law of the Confederate Congress all the tobacco and cotton
in the city had been ordered burned to keep it out of the
hands of the enemy. In vain the Mayor sent a committee
to remonstrate against burning the warehouses. No heed
was paid to the order, and soon tongues of lurid flame were
leaping from building to building, until the conflagration
was beyond all control. Men and women were like frenzied
demons in their efforts to save property; there was terrific
looting. Wagons and carts were hastily loaded with goods;
some carried their things in wheel-barrows, some in their
arms. Women tugged at barrels of flour, and children vainly
tried to move boxes of tobacco. The sidewalks were strewn
with silks, satins, bonnets, fancy goods, shoes, and all sorts
of merchandise. There was no law and there were no
officers; there was only confusion, helpless despair on every
side. Before sunrise there was a terrific explosion which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
shook the whole city; the magazine back of the poorhouse
was blown up.... At six o'clock in the morning the evacuation
was complete, and the railroad bridges were set on fire."</p>

<p>The conflagration was at its height when the vanguard
of the Federal army entered the city, the cavalry galloping
at full speed.</p>

<p>"Which is the way to the Capitol?" they shouted, then
dashed up Governor Street, while a bitter wail rose from
the people of Richmond. "The Yankees! The Yankees!
Oh, the Yankees have taken our city!"</p>

<p>As the cry went up, a United States flag was unfurled
over the Capitol. At once General Weitzel took command
and ordered the soldiers to stop all pillaging and restore
order to the city; but it was many hours before the command
could be fully carried out. Then and only then did
the exhausted, panic-stricken, heart-sick people fully realize
the hideous disaster which had come to their beloved city;
only when they saw the destruction and desolation wrought
by the fire did they fully grasp the awful meaning of the
cry, "On to Richmond!" which for four long years had been
the watch-word of the Union forces.</p>

<p>And how fared it with the Federal Spy during those hours
of anguish for all true Southerners? Betty Van Lew, who
had been in close touch with the Union generals, had for
some time foreseen the coming climax of the four years'
struggle, and weeks earlier she had sent north to General
Butler for a huge American flag, eighteen feet long by nine
wide, which in some unknown way was successfully carried
into Richmond without detection by the picket guard, and
safely secreted in the hidden chamber under the Van Lew
roof.</p>

<p>And now General Lee had surrendered. Virginia was
again to be a State of the Union; came a messenger fleet
of foot, cautious of address, bringing breathless tidings to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the Spy: "Your house is to be burned&mdash;the Confederate
soldiers say so. What can you do to prevent it?"</p>

<p>Even as she listened to his excited words, Betty Van Lew's
heart was throbbing with joyful excitement, despite the uproar
in the city from the constant explosion of shells, the
sound of the blowing up of gun-boats in the harbor, and of
the powder magazines, which was shaking the foundations
of the city, as red flames leaped across the black sky. Even
then there was in the heart of the Spy a wild exultation.
"Oh, army of my country, how glorious was your welcome!"
she exclaims in her diary.</p>

<p>She heard the news that her home was about to be burned.
With head erect and flashing eyes she went out alone and
stood on the white-pillared portico, a fearless little figure,
defying the mob who were gathering to destroy the old
mansion which was so dear to her.</p>

<p>"I know you&mdash;and you&mdash;and you!" she cried out, calling
them each by name, and pointing at one after another.
"General Grant will be in this city within an hour; if this
house is harmed your house shall be burned by noon!" At
the fearless words, one by one they turned, muttering, and
slunk away, and the Van Lew house was neither burned nor
harmed in any way.</p>

<p>The Union troops were coming near now, marching to
the center of the city. As the long, dusty line of men in
blue swung into Main Street, Betty Van Lew ran up to the
secret room under the garret roof, drew out the great flag
for which she had sent in anticipation of this day, and
when the Union soldiers marched past the historic old
mansion, the Stars and Stripes were waving proudly over
its portico. The Confederacy was no more!</p>

<p>Despite her bravery, Betty Van Lew's life was now in
danger. There was urgent need of special protection for
her. Feeling against the northern victors was at fever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
height in poor, desolated, defeated Richmond, and it is
small wonder that one born in their city, who yet stood
openly and fearlessly against all that the Southerners held
sacred, should have been despised, and worse than that.
Realizing her danger, and knowing the priceless service she
had rendered the Union generals in the four long years of
the war, Colonel Parke, with a force of men, was sent to
protect the Spy. To the General's utter amazement they did
not find her in the old house. She was found in the deserted
Capitol, ransacking it for documents which she feared might
be destroyed and which would be a loss to the Government.</p>

<p>As "Crazy Bet" and as a Union Spy, Betty Van Lew's
long and remarkable service of her country was ended.
The Confederacy was dissolved, and again the flag of the
United States of America could rightfully wave from every
building in the land. At the beginning of the war, when
Betty took on herself the r&ocirc;le of Federal Secret Service
agent, she was light of heart, alert of body and mind. Now,
for four years, she had born a heavy burden of fear and
of crushing responsibility, for the sake of a cause for which
she was willing to sacrifice comfort, wealth and other things
which the average woman counts dear, and her heart and
brain were weary.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the inauguration of Grant as President
of the United States, as a reward for her faithful service,
he appointed Betty Van Lew postmistress of Richmond.
Well she knew that her enemies would declare the appointment
a reward for her services against the Confederacy,
and that it would but make her more of an alien in Richmond
than ever she had been before. But she was desperately
poor, so she accepted the position and for eight
years filled it efficiently. When she came in contact with
old friends from time to time in a business way, they were
politely cold, and in her diary she writes:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
"I live, as entirely distinct from the citizens as if I were
plague-stricken. Rarely, very rarely, is our door-bell ever
rung by any but a pauper or those desiring my service."
She adds: "September, 1875, my Mother was taken from
me by death. We had not friends enough to be pall-bearers."</p>

<p>When Grant had been succeeded by Hayes as President
of the United States, the one-time Spy was obliged to ask
for his aid:</p>

<p>"I am hounded down"&mdash;she wrote to his private Secretary.
"I never, never was so bitterly persecuted; ask the
President to protect me from this unwarranted, unmerited,
and unprecedented persecution."</p>

<p>From her own point of view, and from that of those who
fought for the abolition of slavery and the preservation of
the Union, Betty Van Lew's persecution was indeed "unwarranted
and unmerited." But there was another side
to the matter. Elizabeth Van Lew, although the child of a
Northern mother, was also the daughter of John Van Lew,
one of Richmond's foremost citizens. The loyalty of the
Southerners to the Confederacy and to one another, from
their viewpoint, was praiseworthy, and there is every reason
why they should have shunned one of Richmond's
daughters, who not only approved the cause of the hated
Yankees, but who aided the Union generals in their determination
to sweep "On to Richmond, to the defeat of the
Confederacy."</p>

<p>What to one was loyalty, to the other was treason&mdash;what
to the Spy was a point of honor, to her old friends was
her open and lasting disgrace, and never can the two viewpoints
be welded into one, despite the symbol of Union
which floats over North and South, making the United
States of America one and "indivisible, now and forever!"</p>

<p>Betty Van Lew remained postmistress of Richmond for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
eight years, then she was removed, and there were black
years of poverty and loneliness for her, as she had not laid
by a dollar for a day of want, but had given lavishly to
all in need, especially to the negroes. She was not able to
sell her valuable but unproductive real estate, and was
reduced to actual need. "I tell you really and solemnly,"
she confesses to her diary, "I have suffered for necessary
food. I have not one cent in the world. I have stood the
brunt alone of a persecution that I believe no other person
in the country has endured.... I honestly think that the
Government should see that I was sustained."</p>

<p>At last she was given a clerkship in the Post-Office Department
at Washington, but after two years this was taken
from her, probably for political reasons, and it was recommended
that she be given a clerkship of a lower grade.
This was done, and although she was cut by the injustice
of the act, she clung patiently to her only means of support.
Two weeks later, it is said that a Northern newspaper contained
an editorial which spoke sneeringly of "A Troublesome
Relic," and ended with, "We draw the line at Miss
Van Lew." Even though she had not a penny in the
world, she could not bear the sting of that, and she wrote
her resignation, and went back to the great, lonely house
on Church Hill a heart-broken, pitiable woman, who had
given her all for what she believed to be the cause of right
and justice.</p>

<p>But she could not live in the old mansion alone, and without
food or money. In despair she wrote a letter to a friend
in the North, a relative of Col. Paul Revere, whom she had
helped when he was a prisoner in the Libby. She had to
borrow a stamp from an old negro to send the letter, and
even worse to her than that was the necessity of revealing
her desperate plight. But she need not have felt as she did.
As soon as the letter reached its destination there was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
hurried indignation meeting of those Boston men who knew
what she had done for the Union, and immediately and
gladly they provided an ample annuity for her, which
placed her beyond all need for the remaining years of her
life. This was, of course, a great relief; but even so, it could
not ease the burden of her lonely isolation.</p>

<p>"No one will walk with us on the street," she writes;
"no one will go with us anywhere.... It grows worse and
worse as the years roll on...."</p>

<p>And so the weary months and years went by, and at last,
in the old mansion with its haunting memories, nursed by
an aged negress to whom she had given freedom years before,
Elizabeth Van Lew died. Among her effects there
was found on a torn bit of paper this paragraph:</p>

<p>"If I am entitled to the name of 'Spy' because I was in
the Secret Service, I accept it willingly, but it will hereafter
have to my mind a high and honorable significance. For
my loyalty to my country, I have two beautiful names;
here I am called 'Traitor,' farther North a 'Spy,' instead
of the honored name of Faithful."</p>

<p>And well may she be called "Faithful" by both friend
and enemy, for she gave freely of youth and strength, of
wealth and her good name, of all that human beings hold
most sacred, for that which was to her a consecrated and
a just cause.</p>

<p>In the Shockhoe Hill Cemetery of Richmond, there is to
be seen a bronze tablet, erected to the noble woman who
worked tirelessly and without fitting reward for a cause
which she believed to be righteous. The inscription on the
tablet reads:</p>

<p class="center">
Elizabeth L. Van Lew<br />
1818&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1900.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">She risked everything that is dear to man&mdash;friends,<br />
fortune, comfort, health, life itself;<br />
all for the one absorbing desire of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><br />
heart&mdash;that slavery might be abolished and<br />
the Union preserved.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p class="center">This Boulder<br />
<br />
from the Capitol Hill in Boston, is a tribute<br />
from Massachusetts friends.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Van Lew was indeed a Spy working against
the city of her birth, and the friends of her love and loyalty,&mdash;a
traitor in one sense of the word; but above all was she
tireless in working for her highest ideals, and so is she worthy
of respect and honor wherever the Stars and Stripes float free
over united America.</p>

<h2>IDA LEWIS: THE GIRL WHO KEPT LIME ROCK
BURNING; A HEROIC LIFE-SAVER</h2>


<p>"Father has the appointment! We are going to live
on the island, and you must all row over to see me
very often. Isn't it wonderful?"</p>

<p>A bright-faced young girl, surrounded by a group of schoolmates,
poured out her piece of news in such an eager torrent
of words that the girls were as excited as the teller of the tale,
and there was a chorus of: "Wonderful! Of course we will!
What fun to live in that fascinating place! Let's go and
see it now!"</p>

<p>No sooner decided than done, and in a very short time
there was a fleet of rowboats led by that of Ida Lewis, on
their way to the island in Baker's Bay, where the Lime
Rock Light stood, of which Captain Hosea Lewis had just
been appointed keeper.</p>

<p>Ida, Captain Hosea's daughter, was born at Newport,
Rhode Island, on the 25th of February, 1841, and was sent
to school there as soon as she was old enough. She was a
quick-witted, sure-footed, firm-handed girl from her earliest
childhood, and a great lover of the sea in all its changing
phases. Often instead of playing games on land with her
mates she would beguile some old fisherman to take her out
in his fishing dory, and eagerly help him make his hauls,
and by the time she was fourteen years old she was an expert
in handling the oars, and as tireless a swimmer as could be
found in all Newport.</p>

<p>And now her father had been appointed keeper of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Lime Rock Light, the "Ida Lewis" light, as it came to
be known in later years, and the girl's home was no longer
to be on <i>terra firma</i>, but on the rock-ribbed island where
the lighthouse stood, whose beacon-light cast strong, steady
rays across Baker's Bay, to the greater Narragansett Bay,
of which it is only an arm.</p>

<p>The flock of girls in their boats rowed hard and fast across
the silvery water with a steady plash, plash of the dipping
oars in the calm bay, and ever Ida Lewis was in the lead,
heading toward the island with a straight course, and keeping
a close watch for the rocks of which the Bay was full.
She would turn her head, toss back her hair, and call out in
ringing tones to the flock, "'Ware, shoals!" and obediently
they would turn as she turned, follow where she led. Soon
her boat ran its sharp bow against the rocky ledge to which
they had been steering, and with quick confidence Ida
sprang ashore, seized the painter, and drew her boat to a
mooring, while the rest of the fleet came to the landing and
one after another the girls jumped ashore. Then up the
rocky path to the lighthouse filed Ida and her friends,
eager to inspect the queer place which was to be Ida's home.</p>

<p>"How perfectly lovely! How odd! Oh, how I wish I
were going to live here! Ida, you are lucky&mdash;But just
think how the wind will howl around the house in a storm!
Will your father ever let you tend the light, do you think?"</p>

<p>The questions were not answered, and those who asked
them did not expect a response. They all chattered on at
the same time, while they inspected every nook and corner
of their friend's new home. It was a small place, that house
on Lime Rock, built to house the light-keeper's family, but
one which could well answer to the name of "home" to
one as fond of the sea as was Ida Lewis. On the narrow
promontory, with the waves of the quiet bay lapping its
rocky shores, the two-story white house stood like a sea-gull
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
poised for flight. A living-room, with wide windows opening
out on the bay it had, and simple bedrooms where one could
be lulled to sleep by the lapping of waters on every side,
while at the front of the house stood the tower from which
the light sent its searching beams to guide mariners trying
to enter the Newport harbor.</p>

<p>The girls climbed the spiral staircase leading up to the
light, and looked with wonder not unmixed with awe at the
great lamp which was always filled and trimmed for immediate
use&mdash;saw the large bell which tolled continuously
during storm or fog; then they went down again to the sunshiny
out of doors, and were shown the boat-house, not so
far back of the light that it would be difficult to reach in a
storm.</p>

<p>It was all a fairy residence to those young girls, and little
could they imagine that bright-eyed Ida, who was about to
become a lighthouse-keeper's daughter, was to be known in
later years as the Grace Darling of America, because of her
heroic life on that small promontory in Baker's Bay!</p>

<p>The Lewis family settled in the lighthouse as speedily as
possible, and when their simple household goods were arranged,
the island home was a pretty and a comfortable
place, where the howling winds of winter or the drenching,
depressing fogs of all seasons would have no chance to take
from the homelike cheer inside, no matter how severe they
were. Books, pictures, a large rag rug, a model of a sloop,
made by Captain Hosea, family portraits belonging to his
wife&mdash;whose girlhood had been spent on Block Island as the
daughter of Dr. Aaron C. Wiley, and to whose ears the
noise of wind and waves was the music of remembered girlhood&mdash;all
these added to the simple interior of the lighthouse,
while out of doors there was, as Ida said, "All the
sea, all the sky, all the joy of the great free world, and plenty
of room to enjoy it!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
And enjoy it she certainly did, although she had to rise
early and eat the plainest of fare, for the pay of a lighthouse-keeper
would not allow of many luxuries. At night she was
in bed and fast asleep before her friends on land had even
thought of leaving their amusements or occupations for sleep.
It was a healthy life, and Ida grew broad of shoulders,
heavier in weight and as muscular as a boy. Every morning
she inspected her boat, and if it needed bailing out or cleaning
she was at work on it before breakfast; then at the
appointed hour she was ready to row her younger brothers
and sisters to the mainland to school. Like a little housekeeper,
after dropping them, she went to market in Newport
for her mother, and sometimes her boat would be seen crossing
the bay more than once a morning, if there were many
supplies to be carried over; then the children must be rowed
back after school hours. Small wonder that Ida came to
know every rock in the bay, and was able to steer her boat
safely in and out among the many obstructions which were
a peril to less intelligent mariners.</p>

<p>Towering over all neighboring buildings, the Lime Rock
Light stood on its rocky ledge, clearly seen by men on vessels
entering or leaving Narragansett Bay, and by officers and
men at Fort Adams, as well as by those who lived within
sight of the light, and it came to be a daily word, "Watch
for the girl," for Ida sturdily rowed across the bay, no
matter how furious the storm, how dense the fog.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon, after visiting a friend, she was rowing
from Newport at the hour when a snub-nosed schooner sailed
slowly into the harbor on its way from New York to Newport
with every sign of distress visible among its crew, for
not even the Captain knew where lay the channel of safety
between the perilous rocks, and the fog was thick.</p>

<span class="caption">IDA LEWIS</span>
</div>

<div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
</div>

<p>Ida saw the schooner, and guessed its dilemma. Rowing
as close to it as she could, she signaled to the captain to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
follow her, and her words were carried to him on the heavy
air:</p>

<p>"Come on! Don't be afraid!"</p>

<p>Obediently he went on, as the girl directed, and reached
the dock of his destination in safety, where he shook hands
heartily with his bright-eyed guide before she pushed off
again for her island home. Later he spread the news among
his mates that there was a "boss in Baker's Bay who knew
what she was about," and his advice was, "In danger look
for the dark-haired girl in a row-boat and follow her."</p>

<p>This came to be the accepted fashion among captains of
the schooners which in that day plied so frequently between
New York and Newport, and many a letter of thanks, or
a more substantial remembrance, did she receive from some
one she had piloted across the angry bay.</p>

<p>Soldiers trying to reach the fort, or sailors anxious to row
out to their ships, always found a ready ferry-woman in
Ida, and before the Lewis family had been in the lighthouse
for many months she was one of the most popular
young persons on land or sea within many miles&mdash;for who
had ever before seen such a seaworthy young mariner as she,
or where could such a fund of nautical wisdom be discovered
as was stored in her clear head? This question was asked
in affectionate pride by more than one good seaman who had
become Ida's intimate friend at the close of her first year
on Lime Rock, while all the skippers had an intense admiration
for the girl who not only handled her life-boat with a
man's skill, but who kept the light filled and trimmed and
burning to save her father steps, now that he was crippled
with rheumatism.</p>

<p>The heat of summer had given place to the crisp coolness
of a glorious October day as Ida was just starting to row to
the mainland to do an errand for her mother. She looked
out of the window, across the bay, to see if there was any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
prospect of a shower, and her keen eyes glimpsed a sight that
made her hurry for the glass. Looking through it, she gave
a sharp cry and rushed to the door.</p>

<p>"What is it, daughter?" the captain queried.</p>

<p>But Ida was already out of the house. So he hobbled
slowly to the window and, with the use of the glass Ida had
dropped, saw his energetic child push the life-boat out of its
shelter, drag it to the shore, jump in and row rapidly to the
middle of the bay where a pleasure-boat had capsized.
There were four men in the water, struggling with the high
waves which momentarily threatened to overcome them.
When Ida reached them in her life-boat, two were clinging
to the overturned craft, and two were making a desperate
effort to swim toward shore. The watching captain, through
his glass, saw Ida row close to the capsized boat and with
strong, steady hands pull and drag one after another of the
men into her boat. When they were all in, she rowed with
sure strokes back across the stormy water, carrying her load
of human freight to shore and receiving their thanks as
modestly as if she had not done a remarkable deed for a
girl of seventeen. A very fine piece of work was Ida's
first rescue, but by no means her last. She loved to row out
in a storm and dare the winds and waves to do their worst,
and she grew to think her mission a clear one, as life-saver
of the light.</p>

<p>A year after her first experience as life-saver, her father,
who had recently been paralyzed, died, and so capable
was his eighteen-year-old daughter in doing his duties that
she was allowed to continue in the care of the light until
her father's successor should be appointed. When the news
came to her, Ida's eyes gleamed, as if in anticipation of some
happy event, and to her devoted Newfoundland dog she
exclaimed: "We love it too well to give it up to anybody;
don't we, doggie dear? We will succeed to ourselves!" And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
she did succeed to herself, being finally made keeper of the
light by special act of Congress&mdash;the appointment being
conferred upon her in 1879 by General Sherman as a compliment
to her ability and bravery; doubtless because of the
recommendation of those fishermen and seamen whose respect
for the brave girl was great and who did not wish the
government to remove her. In any case, she was chosen for
the responsible position as successor to her father, and to
herself, as she quaintly put it, and more and more she became
devoted to every stone of the small promontory, and
to every smallest duty in connection with her work and her
island home.</p>

<p>Winter and summer passed in the regular routine of her
daily duties as keeper of the light, and every time she lighted
the big lamp whose beams shone out over the waters with
such comforting gleams for watching mariners she was filled
with assurance that hers was the greatest and most interesting
mission in the world.</p>

<p>Winter came with its howling winds and frozen bay. A
terrific storm was blowing from the north; snow was driving
from every direction and it was hardly possible to stand
on one's feet because of the fury of the gale. Ida lighted her
beacon of warning to ships at sea, and rejoiced as she saw
its glowing rays flash out over the turbulent waters. Then
she went down into the cozy kitchen and speedily ate
a simple supper prepared by her mother. How the wind
shrieked around the little house on the island! Ida hastily
raised the curtain, to see how heavily it was storming,
and she gave an exclamation of surprise; then ran
up the spiral stairway to the tower, where in the rays of
the steady light she could see more clearly. Far out on
the waves, beyond the frozen surface of the inner bay, she
saw a light skiff bobbing up and down, the toy of wind and
wave; in it by the aid of her powerful glass she could see a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
stiff, still figure. A man had been overcome by the cold&mdash;he
would die if he were not rescued at once. Quick as a
flash she was down-stairs, in the boat-house, had pulled out
the boat, although it was a hard task in such a storm even
for one as strong as she, and soon was on her way across
that part of the bay which was not frozen. Up and down on
the storm-tossed waves her craft tossed, now righting itself,
now almost submerged&mdash;but Ida pulled on with strong
sure strokes, and drew alongside of the bobbing skiff&mdash;took
hold of it, drew it to the side of her own boat, and, looking
into the face of the man in it, saw that he must be rowed
to land as quickly as possible if he were to be saved. She
saved him. When he regained consciousness he found himself
propped up before the warm fire in the lighthouse
kitchen, with the most delicious feeling of languor stealing
through his whole frame, instead of the cruel numbness
which had been the last sensation before he became unconscious.
And it added materially to his enjoyment that a
bright-eyed, dark-haired young woman hovered around him,
ministering to his wants in a delightful way.</p>

<p>The young lighthouse-keeper's next rescue was of a soldier
from the Fort Adams garrison who, in trying to cross the
harbor in a small boat, was thrown into the bay by the
force of the waves, and would have been drowned, as he
was not a good swimmer, had not Ida's keen eyes seen him
and she gone instantly to his rescue. He was a heavy man,
and Ida tried in vain to lift him into her boat, but was
not strong enough. What should she do? The great waves
were lashing against the boats in such a fury that what
was done must be done quickly. With ready wit she threw
a rope around his body under the arm-pits, and towed him
to shore as hard and fast as she could, at the same time
watching closely that his head did not go under water.
It was a man-sized job, but Ida accomplished it, and, seeing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
his exhaustion when she reached shore, she called two men,
who aided in resuscitating him.</p>

<p>"Who towed him in?" asked one of them, who was a
stranger to Ida.</p>

<p>"I did," she replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, go on!" he said, incredulously. "A girl like you
doing that! Tell me something I can believe!"</p>

<p>Ida laughed and turned to the other man. "He will tell
you what I have done and what I can do, even if I am a girl!"
she said; and the seaman, just landed from a coastwise
steamer, looked at her with admiration tinged with awe.
"She's the boss of these parts," said his companion, "and
the prettiest life-saver on the coast. Just try it yourself
and see!"</p>

<p>As the man did not seem to care about risking his life
to have it saved, even by Ida Lewis, he went his way, but
whenever his steamer touched at Newport after that he
always paid his respects to the "prettiest life-saver on the
coast."</p>

<p>Twelve months went by, with ever-increasing fame for
the girl keeper of Lime Rock Light who had become one of
the features of the vicinity, to meet and talk with whom
many a tourist lengthened a stay in Newport, and Ida
enjoyed meeting them and showing them her light and her
home and her boat and her dog and all her other treasures,
while in return they told her many interesting things about
the great world beyond the beams of her light.</p>

<p>Up in the tower one day&mdash;it was in the autumn of 1867&mdash;she
was looking out over the bay, fearing trouble for some
vessel, as a furious storm was raging, and the wind was
blowing snow in such white sheets that few captains could
make their way among the rocks of the harbor without
difficulty, while any one foolish enough to set out in a rowboat
would find it impossible to reach the shore.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Out flashed the rays of the beacon-light, and far off on
the tempestuous waves Ida saw what seemed to be two
men in a boat with a load of sheep. The wind was howling,
and borne on its shrieking Ida fancied she could hear the
moans of the men and the frightened beasts.</p>

<p>One quick look at her light, to make sure that it was all
right to leave, then down ran the life-saver to her self-appointed
work. Never was there such a gale blowing in
Narragansett Bay, and in the smaller bay white-capped
waves and gusts of wind and rain added to biting, stinging
cold made it almost impossible even for sturdy Ida to
struggle out from the boat-house, to launch her rowboat
on the stormy sea. But she never gave in to any obstacles,
and soon her little boat could be seen making slow headway
across the bay, in the direction of the drifting men and
their cargo of sheep.</p>

<p>Now the wind drove her back, now it blew her small craft
to one side and the other, but steadily, though slowly, she
gained on herself, and at last she reached the men, who
could make no headway in the teeth of such a gale, and were
simply drifting and watching Ida's acts with incredulous
wonder. A young girl&mdash;come to rescue them in such a storm
as this! Quickly she helped them to climb into her boat,
and took up her oars. One man protested. "But the
sheep," he said.</p>

<p>"Leave them to me!" commanded Ida, sternly, rowing as
fast as she could, her dark hair streaming over her shoulders
and her cheeks rose-red from the stinging cold of the air.
Neither man ventured another word. Reaching the rocky
coast of the island, Ida sprang out after them, pointed out
the kitchen door, and said:</p>

<p>"Stay in there and get warm till I come back."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began one.</p>

<p>Ida was already out of hearing, and the men whose lives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
had been saved did as they had been told, and in the warm
kitchen awaited the coming of their rescuer. In an hour
there were footsteps outside, the door opened, and a glowing
girl stepped in out of the bitter gale, stamping her almost
frozen feet and holding out her benumbed hands to the
glowing fire.</p>

<p>"Well, they are all safe on land," she said. "I think they
had better be left in the boat-house overnight. The wind
is in the right quarter for a clear day to-morrow; then you
can put out again."</p>

<p>There was no reply. A girl like this keeper of the Lime
Rock Light left no room for pretty compliments, but made
a man feel that if she could do such deeds with simple courage,
what could he not do with such a spirit as hers! No one
ever paid Ida Lewis higher praise than these two rough
men when, on leaving, they each gripped her hand and the
spokesman said:</p>

<p>"Whenever I see your light shining, I'll put up a prayer
for its keeper, and thanking you for what you did for us,
ma'am&mdash;if my little one's a girl, she will be Ida Lewis!"</p>

<p>Up spoke his comrade: "My daughter's twelve year old
come September next, and I hope she'll be your kind. It'd
make a new kind of a world to have such!"</p>

<p>While such praise did not turn Ida's very level head, or
make her vain, it gave her a deep satisfaction and a tremendous
sense of responsibility in her beloved occupation.</p>

<p>Two years went by, and Ida Lewis was a name which
commanded respect throughout Rhode Island because of
her work for the government, and there was scarcely a
day when she did not direct some wandering boatman or
give valuable aid to a distressed seafarer, but from the day
she brought the men and their load of sheep to shore it was
a year before there was any need of such aid as she had given
them. Then on a day never to be forgotten by those to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
whose rescue she went, she saw two of the soldiers who were
stationed at Fort Adams rowing toward the fort from
Newport. A young lad was at the oars, and he showed
that he was not in any way experienced as a boatman. A
sudden squall overtook the small boat in mid-bay, and, as
Ida Lewis looked at it, it capsized. At the moment Ida
happened to be without hat or coat, or even shoes. Rushing
to the boat-house, she took her staunch friend to the shore,
and launched out in the wild squall under an inky-black sky;
and she had to row against a wind that drove her back time
after time. Finally she reached the wreck, only to find the
boy had gone under. The soldiers were clinging to the
bobbing keel of the boat, and Ida grasped them with a
firm, practised hand, while at the same time managing to
keep her own boat near enough so that when a wave washed
them together she was able to help the exhausted soldiers
to climb into it. They were unable to speak, and one of
them was so exhausted that she feared she could not get him
to land in time to resuscitate him.</p>

<p>With wind-blown hair, and eyes dark with determination,
she rowed as she had never rowed before, and at last her boat
touched the rocky home ledge. Out she jumped, and in less
time than it takes to tell it, she had the men before her
fire, wrapped in blankets. One of them was unconscious
for such a long time that his rescuer was wondering what was
best to do&mdash;to take the risk of leaving him and row to the
mainland for a doctor, or to take the risk of doing for him
with her own inexperienced hands. Just then his blue eyes
opened, and after a drink of stimulant he slowly revived,
and at last was able to talk coherently. The storm was still
raging and the men remained on the lighthouse ledge with
the girl rescuer, for whom they showed open admiration;
then, when the clouds lifted and the moon shone wanly
through the rift, they took their own boat and rowed off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to the fort. But they were staunch friends of Ida Lewis
from that day, and she enjoyed many a chat with them,
and had more than one pleasant afternoon on the mainland
with them when they were off duty.</p>

<p>At another time she was out in her boat in a bad storm,
when through the dense darkness she heard cries of, "Help!
help!" and, rowing in the direction from which the cries
came, she found three men in the water clinging to the keel
of an overturned boat. With her usual promptness in an
emergency, she dragged them all into her boat and took them
to shore. Another day, from the lighthouse tower, she saw
the slender figure of a man clinging to a spindle which was
a mile and a half from the lighthouse. In a very short time
he would be too exhausted to hold on any longer. She must
hurry, hurry! With flying feet she made her boat ready; with
firm strokes she rowed out to the spindle, rescued the man
and bore him safely to shore.</p>

<p>At this time Ida Lewis was so well known as being always
on hand in any emergency that it was taken as a matter of
course to have her appear out of the sky, as one's preserver,
and the man, though extremely grateful, did not seem as
astonished as he might have otherwise been to be saved
from such a death by a young girl who apparently dropped
from the skies just to rescue him.</p>

<p>In all of these experiences, when she was able to save
men's lives at the risk of her own, and was successful by
reason of her quick wit and self-forgetful courage, despite the
grave chances she took, she never had a single fright about
her own safety, but simply flew across the bay at any time
of day or night at the sight of a speck on the water which
to her trained eye was a human being in danger.</p>

<p>Winter's hand had laid its glittering mantle of ice on
Baker's Bay, and on a glorious sunlit morning Ida was
ready to start to Newport to make some necessary purchases.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
When she was just about to push her boat off the rocks
she looked over the bay with the intent, piercing glance for
which she was famous among fisher-folk, who declared she
could "see out of the back of her head," and caught a glimpse
of uniforms, of struggling figures in that part of the bay
which was so shallow as to be always frozen in mid-winter,
and which the soldiers all knew to be dangerous to cross.
But there were two of them, waving their arms in frantic
appeal for help, as they tried to keep from going under in
the icy water of the bay.</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose. Ida put out from shore,
rowed swiftly to a point as near the drowning and freezing
men as was possible, then with her oars broke the ice sufficiently
to make a channel for her boat. As she came near
to them she found that the insecure ice, melted by the strong
sun, had given way under them, while they were evidently
trying to take a short cut to Fort Adams from Newport.</p>

<p>It was hard work and quick work for Ida's experienced
hands to get them into the life-boat; and so nearly frozen
were they that she was obliged to rest on her oars, at the
same time rubbing their numb limbs as well as she could.
Then she rowed for shore faster than she had ever rowed
but once before, and, as she told afterward:</p>

<p>"I flew for restoratives and hot water, and worked so
hard and so fast, rubbing them and heating them, that it was
not long before they came to life again and were sitting up
in front of the fire, apologizing for their folly, and promising
that they would never again give me such a piece of work
to do, or cross the bay in winter at a point where they knew
it was a risk." She added, na&iuml;vely: "They were as penitent
as naughty children, so I took advantage of it and gave them
a lecture on things soldiers ought not to do, among them
drinking whisky&mdash;even with the good excuse of being cold&mdash;and
showing them quite plainly that this scare they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
had came from that bad habit. They seemed very sorry,
and when they got up to go, they saluted me as if I were
their captain. Then off they went to the fort."</p>

<p>Several days later she received a letter of thanks from
the officers at Fort Adams, and a gold watch from the
men she had rescued "in grateful appreciation of a woman's
heroism."</p>

<p>On through the long years Ida Lewis, with hair growing
slowly a little grayer, and with arms a little less equal to
the burden of rowing a heavy boat through fierce winter
gales, was faithful to her duties as keeper of the light, now
never spoken of as the Lime Rock Light, but always as the
Ida Lewis Light; and, although she was always averse to
notoriety, yet she was forced to accept the penalty of her
brave deeds, and welcome the thousands of tourists who
now swarmed daily over the promontory and insisted on a
personal talk with the keeper of the light. Had it not been
for Mrs. Lewis, both aged and feeble, but able to meet and
show the visitors over the island, Ida would have had no
privacy at all and no time for her work.</p>

<p>Although she always disliked praise or publicity, yet she
accepted official recognition of her faithful work with real
appreciation, and it was touching to see her joy when one
day she received a letter bearing the signature of the Secretary
of the Treasury, notifying her that the gold life-saving
medal had been awarded to her&mdash;and stating that she was
the only woman in America upon whom the honor had been
conferred! At a later date she also received three silver
medals: gifts from the State of Rhode Island, and from the
Humane Society of Massachusetts, and also from the New
York Life-Saving Association. All these recognitions of her
achievements Ida Lewis received with shining eyes and wonder
that such praise should have come to her for the
simple performance of her duty. "Any one would rescue a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
drowning man, of course," she said. "I just happen to be
where I see them first!"</p>

<p>But although she was so modest, and although so many
honors were heaped upon her, none ever meant to her what
the first expression of public appreciation meant, shown by
the citizens of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>An invitation had been sent to her, asking her to be present
at the Custom-House at Newport on a certain day in
1869. She accepted the invitation, and went at the appointed
hour without much thought about the matter.
When she reached the Custom-House, to her surprise a committee
of prominent Newport residents met her and escorted
her to a seat on the platform, from which she looked down
on a vast audience, all staring with evident curiosity at the
slight, dark-haired woman in whose honor the throng had
come together. There were speeches so filled with praise
of her deeds that Ida Lewis would have liked to fly from the
sight of the applauding crowd; but instead must sit and
listen. The speeches at an end, there was a moment's pause;
then she found herself on her feet, amid a chorus of cheers,
being presented with a magnificent new life-boat, the <i>Rescue</i>,
a gift from the citizens of Newport as a slight recognition of
her acts of bravery.</p>

<p>Ida never knew all she said in response to the presentation
speech; she only knew that tears streamed down her
cheeks as she gripped a man's hand and said, "Thank you,
thank you&mdash;I don't deserve it!" over and over again, while
the audience stood up and applauded to the echo. As if
that were not enough to overcome any young woman, as she
left the building, James Fisk, Jr., approached her and,
grasping her hand warmly, told her that there was to be a
new boat-house built back of the light, large enough for her
beautiful new boat.</p>

<p>It was late that night before Ida fell asleep, lulled at last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
by the wind and the lapping of the waves, and thinking with
intense happiness not of her own achievements, but of the
pride and joy with which her mother received the account
of her daughter's ovation and gift, and her words rang in
Ida's ears above the noise of the waters, "Your father would
be so proud, dear!"</p>

<p>For fifty-three years Ida Lewis remained the faithful
keeper of her beloved light, and because of her healthy, out-of-door
life we catch a glimpse of the woman of sixty-five
which reminds us strongly of the girl who led the way to
the lighthouse point on that day in 1841, to show her new
home to her schoolmates. In the face of howling winds and
winter gales she had snatched twenty-three lives from the
jaws of death, and in her sixty-fifth year she was at her old
work.</p>

<p>A woman had rowed out to the light from Newport, and
when her boat had almost reached the pier which had been
erected recently on the island shore, she rashly stood on
her feet, lost her balance and fell overboard. Ida Lewis,
who was rowing in near the pier, instantly came to the
rescue, helped the struggling and much frightened woman
into her own boat, and then picked up the other one, which
was drifting away.</p>

<p>Sixty-five years young, and heroic from earliest girlhood
to latest old age! We add our tribute to those heaped on
her head by many who knew her in person and others who
were acquainted only with her heroic acts, and we rejoice
to know that in this year of American crisis we, too, can
reflect the heroism of the keeper of Lime Rock Light, for in
our hands are greater opportunities for wide service and
greater variety of instruments by which to mold the destiny
of nations and save life. Proud are we that we, too,
are American, as was Ida Lewis, and we can give interest
as consecrated and sincere to the work at our hand to-day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
as she gave, whose daily precepts were work and thrift, and
who said, in her quaint way, of the light which had been her
beacon of inspiration for so many years of service:</p>

<p>"The light is my child and I know when it needs me, even
if I sleep. This is home to me, and I hope the good Lord
will take me away when I have to leave it."</p>

<p>Her wish was granted. In the last week of October,
1911, she fell asleep in the lighthouse on Lime Rock, which
had been her home for so long, lulled into an eternal repose
by the wind and waves, which had for many years been
her beloved companions&mdash;and as she slept the beacon-light
which she had for so long kept trimmed and burning sent
out its rays far beyond the little bay where Ida Lewis lay
asleep.</p>

<p>Patriotism, faithfulness, service&mdash;who can reckon their
value? The gleam of Ida Lewis's light flashes inspiration and
determination to our hearts to-day.</p>

<h2>CLARA BARTON: "THE ANGEL OF THE
BATTLEFIELDS"</h2>


<p>For several weeks the sound of hammer and saw had
been heard on the Barton farm where a new barn was
being built. The framework was almost up, and David
Barton and his little sister Clara, with a group of friends,
were eagerly watching the carpenters, who were just fixing
the high rafters to the ridge-pole.</p>

<p>"I dare you to climb to the top, Dave!" suddenly challenged
a boy in the group.</p>

<p>David Barton, who was known as the "Buffalo Bill" of
the neighborhood, always took a dare. Almost before the
challenge had been given his coat was off and he had
started toward the new building amid a chorus of cries:
"Good for you, Dave!" from the group of young spectators
who were always thrilled by his daring exploits. Only
the little sister Clara protested.</p>

<p>"Don't, David," she exclaimed. "It isn't safe."</p>

<p>Her warning was not heeded. Up went the sure-footed
athlete until he had almost reached the topmost peak of
the barn. Crash! a board gave way under his feet, and down
to the ground he was hurled, landing on his back on a pile
of heavy boards. Limp and lifeless he lay there, a strange
contrast to the vigorous young man who had climbed up
the building only a few moments earlier, and the accident
seemed to paralyze the faculties of those who saw it happen.
It was not the builders or the older persons present who spoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
first, but small, dark-eyed, determined Clara, who idolized
her brother.</p>

<p>"Get mother, and go for the doctor, quick!" she commanded,
and in less time than it takes to tell it the entire
Barton family had been summoned to the scene of the disaster,
and a doctor was bending over the unconscious man.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Sally, the grown-up sisters, hastily obeyed
the doctor's orders, and made a room in the farm-house
ready for their injured brother, while Stephen Barton and
one of the workmen carried him in as gently as possible and
laid him on the bed which he was not to leave for many
weary months. Examination proved that the injury was a
serious one, and there was need of careful and continuous
nursing. To the surprise of the whole family, who looked
on eleven-year-old Clara, the youngest of them all, as still
a baby, when Mrs. Barton made ready to take charge of the
sick-room, she found a resolute little figure seated by the
bedside, with determination to remain there showing on
every line of her expressive face.</p>

<p>"Let me take care of him! I can do it&mdash;I want to. Please,
oh, please!" pleaded Clara.</p>

<p>At first the coveted permission was denied her, for how
could a girl so young take care of a dangerously injured man?
But as the weary days and nights of watching wore away
and it seemed as if there would be no end to them, from
sheer exhaustion the older members of the family yielded
their places temporarily to Clara. Then one day when the
doctor came and found her in charge, the sick-room was so
tidy and quiet, and the young nurse was so clear-minded
and ready to obey his slightest order, that when she begged
him to let her take care of her brother he gave his hearty
permission, and Clara had won her way.</p>

<p>From that time on, through long months, she was the
member of the family whose entire thought and care was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
centered in the invalid. David was very sick for such a long
time that it seemed as if he could never rally, and his one
great comfort was having Clara near him. Hour after hour,
and day after day, she sat by his bedside, his thin hand
clasped in her strong one, with the patience of a much older,
wiser nurse. She practically shut herself up in that sick-room
for two whole years, and it seemed as if there was
nothing too hard for her to do well and quickly, if in any way
it would make David more comfortable. Finally a new
kind of bath was tried with success. David was cured, and
Clara Barton had served her earliest apprenticeship as a
nurse.</p>

<p>Let us look back and see what went into the making of
an eleven-year-old child who would give two years of her
life to a task like that.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day of the year 1821, Clarissa Harlowe, as
she was named, or "Clara" Barton, as she was always
called, was born in her father's home near the town of Oxford,
Worcester County, Massachusetts. Her oldest sister
Dorothy was seventeen at that time, and her oldest brother
Stephen, fifteen, while David was thirteen and Sally ten
years old; so it was a long time since there had been a baby
in the family, and all were so delighted over the event that
Clara Barton says in her <i>Recollections</i>, "I am told the family
jubilation upon the occasion was so great that the entire
dinner and tea sets had to be changed for the serving of the
noble guests who gathered."</p>

<p>The house in which the Christmas child was born was a
simple farm-house on a hill-top, and inside nearly everything
was home-made, even the crib in which the baby was
cradled. Outside, the flat flagstone in front of the door was
marked by the hand tools of the father. Stephen Barton,
or Captain Barton as he was called, was a man of marked
military tastes, who had served under "Mad Anthony"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Wayne in campaigns against the Indians. In his youngest
daughter Clara he found a real comrade, and, perched on
his knee, she early gained a passionate love of her country
and a child's simple knowledge of its history through the
thrilling tales he told her. In speaking of those days she says:</p>

<p>"I listened breathlessly to his war stories. Illustrations
were called for, and we made battles and fought them.
Every shade of military etiquette was regarded. Colonels,
captains, and sergeants were given their proper place and
rank. So with the political world; the President, Cabinet,
and leading officers of the government were learned by
heart, and nothing gratified the keen humor of my father
more than the parrot-like readiness with which I lisped
these difficult names." That they did not mean much even
to such a precocious child as Clara Barton is shown by an
incident of those early days, when her sister Dorothy asked
her how she supposed a Vice-President looked.</p>

<p>"I suppose he is about as big as our barn, and green!"
was the quick reply.</p>

<p>But though the child did not understand all that was
poured into her greedy little mind by an eager father, yet
it bore fruit in later years, for she says: "When later I ...
was suddenly thrust into the mysteries of war, and had to
take my place and part in it, I found myself far less a
stranger to the conditions than most women, or even ordinary
men, for that matter. I never addressed a colonel
as captain, got my cavalry on foot, or mounted my infantry!"</p>

<p>When she was not listening to her father's stories or helping
her mother with the housework, which, good housewife
that Mrs. Barton was, she took great pains to teach her
youngest daughter how to do well, Clara was as busy as
possible in some other way. In that household there were
no drones, and the little girl was not even allowed to waste
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
time in playing with dolls, although she was given time to
take care of her pets, of which she had an ever-increasing
collection, including dogs, cats, geese, hens, turkeys, and
even two heifers which she learned to milk.</p>

<p>Dorothy, Sally and Stephen Barton were teachers, and
as Clara early showed her quick mentality, they all took
great interest in educating her according to their different
ideas. As a result, when the little girl was three years old
she could read a story to herself, and knew a little bit about
geography, arithmetic and spelling. That decided the family.
Such a bright mind must be developed as early as
possible. So on a fine, clear winter morning Stephen lifted
her to his shoulders with a swing of his strong arms, and
in that way she rode to the school taught by Col. Richard
C. Stone, a mile and a half from the Barton farm. Although
the new pupil was such a very little girl, and so shy that often
she was not able even to answer when she was spoken to
or to join the class in reciting Bible verses or in singing
songs, yet Colonel Stone was deeply interested in her, and
his manner of teaching was so unusual that the years with
him made a lasting impression on his youngest scholar's
mind. To Clara it was a real loss when, at the end of five
years, the Colonel left the school, to be succeeded by Clara's
sisters in summer and by her brother Stephen in winter.</p>

<p>David was Clara's favorite brother. So athletic was he,
and so fond of all forms of out-of-door life and exercise, that
he was no less than a hero to the little sister, who watched
him with intense admiration, and in her secret heart determined
that some day and in some way she, too, would be
brave and daring.</p>

<p>Having decided this in her own mind, when David suggested
teaching her to ride, she was delighted, and, hiding
her fear, at once took her first lesson on one of the beautiful
blooded colts which were a feature of her father's farm.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
In her <i>Story of My Childhood</i> she says: "It was David's
delight to take me, a little girl five years old, to the field,
seize a couple of those beautiful grazing creatures, broken
only to the halter and bit, and, gathering the reins of both
bridles in one hand, throw me on the back of one colt,
spring on the other himself, and, catching me by the foot
and bidding me 'cling fast to the mane,' gallop away over
field and fen, in and out among the other colts, in wild glee
like ourselves. They were merry rides we took. This was
my riding-school. I never had any other, but it served me
well.... Sometimes in later years when I found myself
on a strange horse, in a troop saddle, flying for life or liberty
in front of pursuit, I blessed the baby lessons of the wild
gallops among the colts."</p>

<p>And so it was that the child grew strong in body and
alert in mind, while the routine of daily farm duties, when
she was not at school or galloping over the fields with
David, developed her in concentration and in inventive
ability. Housekeeping at that time was crude, and most of
the necessary articles used were made at home. There were
no matches. The flint snapped by the lock was the only way of
lighting a fire. Garments were homespun, and home-made
food was dried, canned and cooked in large quantities by
the busy housekeeper. Although there was always a fire
blazing on the hearth of the home, it was thought to be a
religious duty to have the meeting-house unheated on the
Sabbath day. Little Clara, who was particularly susceptible
to cold, bore the bitter chill of the building as bravely as she
could, each week in the long winter, but one Sunday as she
sat in the big pew, not daring to swing her feet, they grew
more and more numb until at last, when she was obliged to
stand on them, she fell over&mdash;her poor little feet were
frozen, and she had to be carried home and thawed out!</p>

<p>When she was eight years old her father left his hill farm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and moved down to the Learned house, a much bigger farm
of three hundred acres, with the brook-like French river
winding through its broad meadows, and three great barns
standing in the lowlands between the hill and the house.
Stephen and David remained on the hill to work their small
farms there, and the other sisters stayed there, but Clara
was not lonesome in the new home in the valley, for at that
time she had as playmates the four children of Captain
Barton's nephew, who had recently died. With them Clara
played hide-and-seek in the big hay-mows, and other interesting
games. Her most marked characteristic then and for
many years afterward was her excessive shyness, yet when
there was anything to do which did not include conversation
she was always the champion. At times she was so bashful
that even speaking to an intimate friend was often an agony
to her, and it is said she once stayed home from meeting on
Sunday rather than tell her mother that her gloves were too
worn out to wear!</p>

<p>Inside the new house she found many fascinating things
to do, and did them with eager interest. The house was being
redecorated, and Clara went from room to room, watching
the workmen, and even learned to grind and mix paints.
Then she turned her attention to the paperers, who were so
much amused with the child's cleverness that they showed
her how to match, trim and hang paper, and in every room
they good-naturedly let her paste up some piece of the decoration,
so she felt that the house was truly hers, and never
lost her affection for it in any of her later wanderings or
changes of residence.</p>

<p>When the new home was completed inside Clara turned
her attention to out-of-door matters and found more than
one opportunity for daring feats. With shining eyes and
bated breath, she learned to cross the little winding French
river on teetering logs at its most dangerous depths. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
this grew tame, she would go to the sawmill and ride out on
the saw carriage twenty feet above the stream, and be pulled
back on the returning log, and oh the joy of such dangerous
sport!</p>

<p>By the time she was eleven years old her brothers had been
so successful with their hill farms that they followed their
father down to the valley of the river, where they bought
the sawmill and built new dams and a grain-mill, and Sally
and Stephen, who both married, settled in homes near the
Barton farm. Then came the building of the new barn and
David's accident. Eleven-year-old Clara, a child in years
but mature mentally, proved equal to the emergency and
took up her r&ocirc;le of nurse in the same vigorous way she went
about everything&mdash;but she had to pay a high price for her
devotion.</p>

<p>David was strong and well again, but the little sister who
had been his constant companion through the weary months
was far from normal. The family had been so occupied with
the invalid that no thought had been given to his young
nurse. Now with grave concern Captain Barton talked with
his wife.</p>

<p>"She has not gained an ounce in weight in these two
years," he said, "and she isn't an inch taller. If anything,
she seems to be more morbidly self-conscious and shy than
ever. What shall we do with her?"</p>

<p>That was the question. The years shut up in the sick-room
had completely unfitted Clara for ordinary life; she
seemed to be more afraid of speaking to any one, more afraid
of being seen or talked to than ever before. All took a hand
at helping her to forget herself. Sally, who knew what an
imaginative nature her small sister had, interested her in
reading poetry, which was a delight to Clara. At the same
time her father and brothers kept her out-of-doors as much
as possible, and her father gave her a fine horse of her own.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
She named him Billy, and at once jumped on his back to
get acquainted. From that time the slim, graceful animal
with his youthful rider became one of the features of the
neighborhood as they galloped across country. But, despite
all that was done to make her healthy and happy, her self-consciousness
and shyness remained, and another way of
curing her was tried. She was sent to the boarding-school
which was kept by her old teacher, Colonel Stone. He was
delighted to have her in the school, and her quick mind was
an amazement to him; but she was so homesick that often
it was impossible for her to study or to recite, while being
with one hundred and fifty girls of her own age made her
more bashful than ever. In despair, Colonel Stone advised
her father to take her home before she became seriously
sick, and soon she found herself again in her beloved haunts.
After that time her brother Stephen taught her mathematics;
and later, when two fine teachers came to Oxford,
she studied Latin, philosophy and chemistry with them,
besides literature, history and languages&mdash;finding herself far
ahead of the other scholars of her age, although she had
been buried in a sick-room for two years.</p>

<p>As long as she was busy she was contented, but when vacation
came she was again miserable. Her active mind and
body demanded constant work; when she did not have it
she was simply wretched, and made those around her so.</p>

<p>One day, when she was in her brother's mill watching
the busy weavers, she had a sudden desire to work a loom
herself. When she mentioned this at home her mother was
horrified, but Stephen, who understood her restless nature
better, took Clara's side and a few days later she proudly
took her place before her loom and with enthusiastic persistence
mastered the mysteries of the flying shuttle. How
long she would have kept on with the work cannot be guessed,
for on the fifteenth day after she began work the mill burned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
down, and she was again on the look-out for new employment
for her active brain and body.</p>

<p>That she was a real girl was shown when, having discovered
that she had no summer hat, she decided she must
have one. Walking through the rye-fields, she had an idea.
With quick interest in a new accomplishment, she cut a
number of green rye stalks, carried them into the house and
scalded them, then laid them out in the sun to bleach, and
when they were white, she cut them into even lengths,
pulled them apart with her teeth, braided them in eleven
strands and made the first straw bonnet she ever owned.</p>

<p>Somehow or other the months of vacation wore away;
then the question was, what to do next? Her nature demanded
constant action. She was far ahead of others of
her own age in the matter of studies, and Mrs. Barton was
in real bewilderment as to what to do with her youngest
child. A phrenologist, who was a keen observer of child
nature, was visiting the Bartons at that time, and Clara,
who had the mumps and was lying on the lounge in the
adjoining room, heard her mother tell their guest of her
daughter's restlessness and self-consciousness and ask his
advice. Listening eagerly, she heard his reply:</p>

<p>"The sensitive nature will always remain," he said. "She
will never assert herself for herself; she will suffer wrong
first. But for others she will be perfectly fearless. Throw
responsibility upon her. Give her a school to teach."</p>

<p>The very words, "give her a school to teach," sent a shiver
of fear through Clara's frame, as she lay there listening,
but at the same time she felt a thrill of pleasure at the idea
of doing something so important as teaching. If her mother
was so much troubled about her peculiar traits as to be
obliged to talk them over with a stranger, they must be
very hard to bear. She would set to work to be something
quite different, and she would begin at once!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
And so it happened that when Clara Barton was fifteen
years old she followed in the footsteps of her brother and
sisters and became a teacher. As soon as she decided to
take the step, she was given District School No. 9, up in
"Texas village," and in May, 1836, "after passing the teachers'
examination with a mark of 'excellent,' she put down
her skirts and put up her hair and walked to the little schoolhouse,
to face and address her forty scholars." That was
one of the most awful moments of her life. When the rows
of pupils were ranged before her, and she was supposed to
open the exercises by reading from the Bible, she could not
find her voice, and her hand trembled so visibly that she
was afraid to turn the pages and so disclose her panic.
But no one knew. With perfect outward calmness, she
kept her eyes on the open book until her pulse beat less fast,
then she looked straight ahead and in a steady voice asked
them to each read a verse in turn. This was a new and
delightful plan to her pupils, who were still more pleased
when the reading was over to have the new teacher question
them in a friendly way about the meaning of the verses
they had just read in the "Sermon on the Mount."</p>

<p>That first day proved her marked ability as a teacher, and
so kindly and intimate was she with her scholars that they
became more her comrades than her pupils. When the four
rough boys of the school "tried her out" to see how much
she could endure, to their astonishment, instead of being
able to lock her out of the building as they had done with
the previous teacher, she showed such pluck and physical
strength that their respect was won and kept. After that,
almost daily, at recess time she would join them in games
such as no teacher had ever played with them before. And
with her success Clara gained a new assurance and a less
shy manner, although she never entirely lost her self-consciousness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
So successful was she with that first school that it was
the preface to sixteen years of continuous teaching, winter
and summer. Her two most interesting experiences as
a teacher were in North Oxford and in Bordentown,
New Jersey. North Oxford was the mill village where
her brother's factories were, and where there were hundreds
of children. When her popularity as the teacher
in No. 9, Texas village, spread to North Oxford, she was
asked to go there to start a school for operatives. This
was a piece of work to her liking, and for ten years she
says: "I stood with them in the crowded school-room
summer and winter, without change or relaxation. I saw
my little lisping boys become overseers, and my stalwart
overseers become business men and themselves owners of
mills. My little girls grew to be teachers and mothers
of families." Here was satisfying work for the busy brain
and active body! But even that did not take up all of
her time; she found long hours in which to read and
study, and also acted as Stephen's bookkeeper in the mill,
during those years in North Oxford.</p>

<p>At the end of the ten years she broke away from the
routine of teaching and became a pupil herself in Clinton
Liberal Institute in New York, as there were no colleges for
women at that time. The year of study refreshed her in
mind and body, and, as her mother died during the year
and her father decided to live with his married children,
Clara was free to seek the work of the world wherever it
should claim her.</p>

<p>From the seminary she went to Hightstown to teach,
and while there rumors of her ability to cope with conditions
and unruly scholars reached the village of Bordentown, ten
miles away from Hightstown. Many attempts had been
made to start a public school there, but without success.
As a result the children of the poor ran wild in the streets,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
or when an attempt was made to open a school they broke
up the sessions by their lawless behavior. When she heard
this, Clara Barton was so greatly interested that she went
to Bordentown to talk it over with the town officials, who
told her that it was useless to think of making the experiment
again.</p>

<p>Clara Barton's eyes flashed with determination. "Give
me three months, and I will teach free!" she said.</p>

<p>As a result of her generous offer, she was allowed to rent
a tumble-down, unoccupied building, and opened her school
with six pupils! Every one of the six became so enthusiastic
over a teacher who was interested in each individual that
their friends were eager to be her pupils, too, and parents
were anxious to see what the wonderful little bright-eyed,
friendly woman could do for their children. At the end of
five weeks the building was too small for her scholars, and
the roll-call had almost six hundred names on it. To a
triumphant teacher who had volunteered her services to try
an experiment, a regular salary was now offered and an
assistant given her. And so Clara Barton again proved her
talent for teaching.</p>

<p>But Bordentown was her last school. When she had been
there for two years and perfected the public-school system,
her voice gave out as a result of constant use, and she went
to Washington for a rest. But it did not take her long to
recuperate, and soon she was eagerly looking out for some
new avenue of opportunity to take the place of teaching.
Government work interested her, and she heard rumors of
scandals in the Patent Office, where some dishonest clerks
had been copying and selling the ideas of inventors who had
filed patents. This roused her anger, for she felt the inventors
were defrauded and undefended individuals who needed
a protector. As her brother's bookkeeper, she had developed
a clear, copper-plate handwriting, which would aid her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
in trying to get the position she determined to try for.
Through a relative in Congress she secured a position in the
Patent Office, and when it was proved that she was acceptable
there, although she was the first woman ever appointed
independently to a clerkship in the department, she
was given charge of a confidential desk, where she had the
care of such papers as had not been carefully enough
guarded before. Her salary of $1,400 a year was as much as
was received by the men in the department, which created
much jealousy, and she had many sneers and snubs and
much disagreeable treatment from the other clerks; but she
went serenely on her way, doing her duty and enjoying the
new line of work with its chances for observation of the
government and its working.</p>

<p>War clouds were now beginning to gather over both
North and South, and signs of an approaching conflict were
ominously clear in Washington, where slavery sentiments
swayed all departments. Clara Barton saw with keen mental
vision all the signs of the times, and there was much to
worry her, for from the first she was clearly and uncompromisingly
on the unpopular side of the disturbing question,
and believed with Charles Sumner that "Freedom is national;
slavery is sectional." She believed in the Union
and she believed in the freedom of the individual. So eager
was she to help the government in the coming national
crisis that she offered her services as a clerk, to do the work
of two dishonest men; for this work she was to receive the
salary of one clerk, and pay back into the Treasury that of
the other, in order to save all the money possible for an
emergency. No deed gives a clearer insight into the character
of Clara Barton than that. As it was in the case of
the school in Bordentown, so was it now. If public service
was the question, she had no thought of self or of money&mdash;the
point was to achieve the desired end. And now she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
nearer the goal of her own personal service to the world
than she dreamed.</p>

<p>Fort Sumter was fired on. President Lincoln called for
seventy-five thousand troops, and all those who were at
the seat of government knew that the hour for sacrifice
of men and money had come. Massachusetts responded
to the call for troops with four regiments, one of which,
the Sixth, set out for Washington at once. As they
marched through the streets of Baltimore they were attacked
by a furious mob who succeeded in killing four
soldiers and wounding many more, but the troopers
fought them off as bravely as possible and marched on
to the station, where they entrained for Washington,
many of them arriving there in a pitiable condition.
When they detrained at the national capital they were
met by a large number of sympathetic women, among
them Clara Barton, who recognized some of her old friends
and pupils among those who were limping, or with injured
arms, or carried on stretchers, and her heart went out to
them in loyalty and pride, for they were giving their services
to their country in an hour of need.</p>

<p>The men who had not been injured were temporarily
quartered at the Capitol, while the wounded were taken to
the Infirmary, where their wounds were dressed at once,
any material on hand being used. When the supply of handkerchiefs
gave out, Clara Barton, as well as other impromptu
nurses, rushed to their homes and tore up sheets for bandages,
and Miss Barton also filled a large box full of needles,
pins, buttons, salves and other necessities, and carried it
back to the Infirmary, where she had her first experience
in caring for wounded soldiers. When she could leave the
Infirmary, she went to the Capitol and found the poor fellows
there famished, for they had not been expected and
their commissary stores had not yet been unloaded. Down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to the market hurried the energetic volunteer nurse, and
soon came back carrying a big basketful of supplies, which
made a feast for the hungry men. Then, as she afterward
wrote in a letter to a friend, "the boys, who had just one
copy of the <i>Worcester Spy</i> of the 22nd, were so anxious to
know its contents that they begged me to read it to them,
which I did&mdash;mounting to the desk of the President of the
Senate, that they all might hear."</p>

<p>In her letter she says, "You would have smiled to see <i>me</i>
and my <i>audience</i> in the Senate Chamber of the U. S. A."
and adds: "God bless the noble fellows who leave their
quiet happy homes at the call of their country. So far as
our poor efforts can reach, they shall never lack a kindly
hand or a sister's sympathy if they come."</p>

<p>Eager to have the soldiers given all the comforts and
necessities which could be obtained, Miss Barton put an
advertisement in the <i>Worcester Spy</i>, asking for supplies
and money for the wounded and needy in the Sixth Regiment,
and stating that she herself would receive and give
them out. The response was overwhelming. So much food
and clothing was sent to her that her small apartment overflowed
with supplies, and she was obliged to rent rooms in a
warehouse to store them.</p>

<p>And now Clara Barton was a new creature. She felt within
herself the ability to meet a great need, and the energy
which for so long had been pent up within her was poured
out in a seemingly unending supply of tenderness and of help
for suffering humanity. There was no time now for sensitiveness,
or for shyness; there was work to do through the
all-too-short days and nights of this struggle for freedom
and unity of the nation. Gone was the teacher, gone the
woman of normal thought and action, and in her place we
find the "Angel of the Battlefields," who for the remainder of
her life was to be one of the world's foremost figures in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
ministrations to the suffering, where suffering would otherwise
have had no alleviation.</p>

<p>"On the 21st of July the Union forces were routed at Bull
Run with terrific loss of life and many wounded. Two
months later the battle of Ball's Bluff occurred, in which
there were three Massachusetts regiments engaged, with
many of Clara Barton's lifelong friends among them. By
this time the hospitals and commissaries in Washington had
been well organized, and there was no desperate need for
the supplies which were still being shipped to Miss Barton
in great quantities, nor was there need of her nursing. However,
she went to the docks to meet the wounded and dying
soldiers, who were brought up the Potomac on transports."
Often they were in such a condition from neglect that they
were baked as hard as the backs of turtles with blood and
clay, and it took all a woman's swift and tender care, together
with the use of warm water, restoratives, dressings,
and delicacies to make them at all comfortable. Then
their volunteer nurse would go with them to the hospitals,
and back again in the ambulance she would drive, to repeat
her works of mercy.</p>

<p>But she was not satisfied with this work. If wounds could
be attended to as soon as the men fell in battle, hundreds
of deaths could be prevented, and she made up her mind
that in some way she was going to override public sentiment,
which in those early days of the war did not allow women
nurses to go to the front, for she was determined to go to
the very firing-line itself as a nurse. And, as she had got her
way at other times in her life, so now she achieved her end, but
after months of rebuffs and of tedious waiting, during which
the bloody battle of Fair Oaks had been fought with terrible
losses on each side. The seven days' retreat of the Union
forces under McClellan followed, with eight thousand
wounded and over seventeen hundred killed. On top of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
came the battle of Cedar Mountain, with many Northerners
killed, wounded and missing.</p>

<p>One day, when Assistant Quartermaster-General Rucker,
who was one of the great-hearts of the army, was at his desk,
he was confronted by a bright-eyed little woman, to whose
appeal he gave sympathetic attention.</p>

<p>"I have no fear of the battle-field," she told him. "I
have large stores, but no way to reach the troops."</p>

<p>Then she described the condition of the soldiers when they
reached Washington, often too late for any care to save them
or heal their wounds. She <i>must</i> go to the battle-front where
she could care for them quickly. So overjoyed was she
to be given the needed passports as well as kindly interest
and good wishes that she burst into tears as she gripped the
old soldier's hand, then she hurried out to make immediate
plans for having her supplies loaded on a railroad car. As
she tersely put it, "When our armies fought on Cedar Mountain,
I broke the shackles and went to the field." When
she began her work on the day after the battle she found an
immense amount of work to do. Later she described her
experience in this modest way:</p>

<p>"Five days and nights with three hours' sleep&mdash;a narrow
escape from capture&mdash;and some days of getting the wounded
into hospitals at Washington brought Saturday, August
30th. And if you chance to feel that the positions I occupied
were rough and unseemly for a woman, I can only reply
that they were rough and unseemly for men. But under
all, lay the life of a nation. I had inherited the rich blessing
of health and strength of constitution such as are seldom
given to women, and I felt that some return was due from
me and that I ought to be there."</p>

<p>The famous army nurse had served her novitiate now,
and through the weary years of the war which dragged on
with alternate gains and losses for the Union forces, Clara
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Barton's name began to be spoken of with awe and deep
affection wherever a wounded man had come under her
gentle care. Being under no society or leader, she was free
to come or go at will. But from the first day of her work
at the front she was encouraged in it by individual officers
who saw the great value of what she accomplished.</p>

<p>At Antietam, when the fighting began, her wagons were
driven through a field of tall corn to an old homestead, while
the shot whizzed thick around them. In the barnyard and
among the corn lay torn and bleeding men&mdash;the worst cases,
just brought from the places where they had fallen. All
was in confusion, for the army medical supplies had not yet
arrived, and the surgeons were trying to make bandages of
corn husks. The new army nurse immediately had her
supplies unloaded and hurried out to revive the wounded
with bread soaked in wine. When her bread gave out there
were still many to be fed. All the supplies she had were
three cases of unopened wine.</p>

<p>"Open the wine, and give that," she commanded, "and
God help us."</p>

<p>Her order was obeyed, and as she watched the cases being
unpacked her eyes fell on the packing around the bottles of
wine. It was nicely sifted corn-meal. If it had been gold
dust it could not have been more valuable. The wine was
unpacked as quickly as possible; kettles were found in the
farm-house, and in a twinkling that corn-meal was mixed
with water, and good gruel for the men was in the making.
Then it occurred to Miss Barton to see what was in the
cellar of the old house, and there three barrels of flour and
a bag of salt were found, stored by the rebels and left behind
when they marched away. "What wealth!" exclaimed
the woman, who was frantically eager to feed her flock.
All that night Clara Barton and her workers carried
buckets of hot gruel up and down the long lines to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
wounded and dying men. Then up to the farm-house went
the army nurse, where, in the dim light of a lone flickering
candle, she could dimly see the surgeon in charge, sitting
in apparent despair by the table, his head resting in his
hands. She tiptoed up to him and said, quietly, "You are
tired, doctor."</p>

<p>Looking up, he exclaimed: "Tired? Yes, I am tired!
Tired of such heartlessness and carelessness! And," he
added, "think of the condition of things. Here are at least
one thousand wounded men; terribly wounded, five hundred
of whom cannot live till daylight without attention.
That two-inch of candle is all I have, or can get. What can
I do? How can I bear it?"</p>

<p>A smile played over Clara Barton's clear-cut face. Gently
but firmly she took him by the elbow and led him to the
door, pointing toward the barn, where dozens of lanterns
gleamed like stars.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The barn is lighted," she said, "and the house will be
directly."</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>"I, doctor."</p>

<p>"Where did you get them?"</p>

<p>"Brought them with me."</p>

<p>"How many have you?"</p>

<p>"All you want, four boxes."</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at her as if to be sure he was not
in a dream. Then he turned away without a word, and
never spoke of the matter again, but his deference to Clara
Barton from that time was the greatest a man can pay a
woman.</p>

<p>Not until all her stores were exhausted and she was sick
with a fever would Clara Barton leave the battle-field of
Antietam; then, dragging herself to the train, she went back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to Washington to be taken care of until she was better.
When at last she was strong enough to work again she went
to see her friend Quartermaster-General Rucker, and told
him that if she had had five wagons she would have had
enough supplies for all the wounded at Antietam. With
an expression of intense admiration on his soldierly face
as he watched the brave volunteer nurse, he declared:</p>

<p>"You shall have enough next time!"</p>

<p>The promise was made good. Having recognized the value
of her efficient services, the Government assisted in every
way, making it possible for her to carry on her work on
the battle-fields and in military camps and hospitals in the
best way.</p>

<p>Clara Barton!&mdash;Only the men who lay wounded or dying
on the battle-field knew the thrill and the comfort that the
name carried. Again and again her life was in danger&mdash;once
at Antietam, when stooping to give a drink of water
to an injured boy, a bullet whizzed between them. It ended
the life of the poor lad, but only tore a hole in Clara Barton's
sleeve. And so, again and again, it seemed as if a special
Providence protected her from death or injury. At Fredericksburg,
when the dead, starving and wounded lay frozen
on the ground, and there was no effective organization for
proper relief, with swift, silent efficiency Clara Barton moved
among them, having the snow cleared away and under the
banks finding famished, frozen figures which were once men.
She rushed to have an old chimney torn down and built
fire-blocks, over which she soon had kettles full of coffee and
gruel steaming.</p>

<p>As she was bending over a wounded rebel, he whispered
to her: "Lady, you have been kind to me ... every street
of the city is covered by our cannon. When your entire
army has reached the other side of the Rappahannock,
they will find Fredericksburg only a slaughter-pen. Not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
regiment will escape. Do not go over, for you will go to
certain death."</p>

<p>She thanked him for the kindly warning and later told of
the call that came to her to go across the river, and what
happened. She says:</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock of the battle day when the rebel fire was
hottest, the shells rolling down every street, and the bridge
under the heavy cannonade, a courier dashed over, and,
rushing up the steps of the house where I was, placed in my
hand a crumpled, bloody piece of paper, a request from the
lion-hearted old surgeon on the opposite shore, establishing
his hospitals in the very jaws of death:</p>

<p>"'Come to me,' he wrote. 'Your place is here.'</p>

<p>"The faces of the rough men working at my side, which
eight weeks before had flushed with indignation at the
thought of being controlled by a woman, grew ashy white
as they guessed the nature of the summons, ... and they
begged me to send them, but save myself. I could only
allow them to go with me if they chose, and in twenty minutes
we were rocking across the swaying bridge, the water
hissing with shot on either side.</p>

<p>"Over into that city of death, its roofs riddled by shell,
its every church a crowded hospital, every street a battle-line,
every hill a rampart, every rock a fortress, and every
stone wall a blazing line of forts.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a day's work was that! How those long lines
of blue, rank on rank, charged over the open acres, up to
the very mouths of those blazing guns, and how like grain
before the sickle they fell and melted away.</p>

<p>"An officer stepped to my side to assist me over the
d&eacute;bris at the end of the bridge. While our hands were raised
in the act of stepping down, a piece of an exploding shell
hissed through between us, just below our arms, carrying
away a portion of both the skirts of his coat and my dress,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
rolling along the ground a few rods from us like a harmless
pebble in the water. The next instant a solid shot thundered
over our heads, a noble steed bounded in the air and with
his gallant rider rolled in the dirt not thirty feet in the rear.
Leaving the kind-hearted officer, I passed on alone to the
hospital. In less than a half-hour he was brought to me&mdash;dead."</p>

<p>She was passing along a street in the heart of the city
when she had to step aside to let a regiment of infantry
march by. At that moment General Patrick saw her, and,
thinking she was a frightened resident of the city who had
been left behind in the general exodus, leaned from his
saddle and said, reassuringly:</p>

<p>"You are alone and in great danger, madam. Do you
want protection?"</p>

<p>With a rare smile, Miss Barton said, as she looked at the
ranks of soldiers, "Thank you, but I think I am the best-protected
woman in the United States."</p>

<p>The near-by soldiers caught her words and cried out:</p>

<p>"That's so! That's so!" and the cheer they gave was
echoed by line after line, until the sound of the shouting
was like the cheers after a great victory. Bending low with
a courtly smile, the general said:</p>

<p>"I believe you are right, madam!" and galloped away.</p>

<p>"At the battles of Cedar Mountain, Second Bull Run,
Antietam, during the eight months' siege of Charleston, in
the hospital at Fort Wagner, with the army in front of
Petersburg and in the Wilderness and the hospitals about
Richmond, there was no limit to the work Clara Barton
accomplished for the sick and dying, but among all her experiences
during those years of the war, the Battle of Fredericksburg
was most unspeakably awful to her. And yet
afterward she saw clearly that it was this defeat that gave
birth to the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"And the white May blossoms of '63 fell over the glad
faces&mdash;the swarthy brows, the toil-worn hands of four
million liberated slaves. 'America,' writes Miss Barton,
'had freed a race.'"</p>

<p>As the war drew to an end, President Lincoln received
hundreds of letters from anxious parents asking for news of
their boys. There were eighty thousand missing men whose
families had no knowledge whether they were alive or dead.
In despair, and believing that Clara Barton had more information
of the soldiers than any one else to whom he could
turn, the President requested her to take up the task, and the
army nurse's tender heart was touched by the thought of
helping so many mothers who had no news of their boys, and
she went to work, aided by the hospital and burial lists she
had compiled when on the field of action.</p>

<p>For four years she did this work, and it was a touching
scene when she was called before the Committee on Investigation
to tell of its results. With quiet simplicity she stood
before the row of men and reported, "Over thirty thousand
men, living and dead, already traced. No available funds
for the necessary investigation; in consequence, over eight
thousand dollars of my own income spent in the search."</p>

<p>As the men confronting her heard the words of the bright-eyed
woman who was looked on as a sister by the soldiers
from Maine to Virginia, whose name was a household one
throughout the land, not one of them was ashamed to wipe
the tears from his eyes! Later the government paid her
back in part the money she had spent in her work; but
she gave her time without charge as well as many a dollar
which was never returned, counting it enough reward to
read the joyful letters from happy, reunited families.</p>

<p>While doing this work she gave over three hundred lectures
through the East and West, and as a speaker she held
her audiences as if by magic, for she spoke glowingly about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the work nearest to her heart, giving the proceeds of her
lectures to the continuance of that work. One evening in
the winter of 1868, when speaking in one of the finest opera-houses
in the East, before one of the most brilliant assemblages
she had ever faced, her voice suddenly gave out, as
it had in the days when she was teaching. The heroic army
nurse and worker for the soldiers was worn out in body and
nerves. As soon as she was able to travel the doctor commanded
that she take three years of absolute rest. Obeying
the order, she sailed for Europe, and in peaceful Switzerland
with its natural beauty hoped to regain normal strength;
for her own country had emerged from the black shadow of
war, and she felt that her life work had been accomplished,
that rest could henceforth be her portion.</p>

<p>But Clara Barton was still on the threshold of her complete
achievement. When she had been in Switzerland only a
month, and her broken-down nerves were just beginning to
respond to the change of air and scene, she received a call
which changed the color of her future. Her caller represented
the International Committee of the Red Cross
Society. Miss Barton did not know what the Red Cross was,
and said so. He then explained the nature of the society,
which was founded for the relief of sick and wounded soldiers,
and he told his eager listener what she did not know,
that back of the Society was the Geneva Treaty, which had
been providing for such relief work, signed by all the civilized
nations except her own. From that moment a new ambition
was born in Clara Barton's heart&mdash;to find out why
America had not signed the treaty, and to know more about
the Red Cross Society.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, while still resting in quiet Switzerland,
there broke one day upon the clear air of her Swiss
home the distant sounds of a royal party hastening back
from a tour of the Alps. To Miss Barton's amazement it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
came in the direction of her villa. Finally flashed the scarlet
and gold of the liveries of the Grand Duke of Baden. After
the outriders came the splendid coach of the Grand Duchess,
daughter of King Wilhelm of Prussia, so soon to be Emperor
William of Germany. In it rode the Grand Duchess.
After presenting her card through the footman, she herself
alighted and clasped Miss Barton's hand, hailing her
in the name of humanity, and said she already knew her
through what she had done in the Civil War. Then, still
clasping her hand in a tight grip of comradeship, she begged
Miss Barton to leave Switzerland and aid in Red Cross work
on the battle-fields of the Franco-Prussian War, which was
in its beginnings. It was a real temptation to once again
work for suffering humanity, yet she put it aside as unwise.
But a year later, when the officers of the International Red
Cross Society came again to beg that Miss Barton take the
lead in a great systematic plan of relief work such as that for
which she had become famous during the Civil War, she
accepted. In the face of such consequences as her health
might suffer from her decision, she rose, and, with head
held high and flashing eyes, said:</p>

<p>"Command me!"</p>

<p>Clara Barton was no longer to be the Angel of the American
battle-fields only&mdash;from that moment she belonged to
the world, and never again could she be claimed by any one
country. But it is as the guardian angel of our soldiers in
the United States that her story concerns us, although there
is reason for great pride in the part she played in nursing
the wounded at Strassburg, and later when her presence
carried comfort and healing to the victims of the fight with
the Commune in Paris.</p>

<p>As tangible results of her work abroad, she was given
an amethyst cut in the shape of a pansy, by the Grand
Duchess of Baden, also the Serbian decoration of the Red
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Cross as the gift of Queen Natalie, and the Gold Cross of
Remembrance, which was presented her by the Grand Duke
and Duchess of Baden together. Queen Victoria, with her
own hand, pinned an English decoration on her dress. The
Iron Cross of Germany, as well as the Order of Melusine
given her by the Prince of Jerusalem, were among an array
of medals and pendants&mdash;enough to have made her a much-bejeweled
person, had it been her way to make a show of her
own rewards.</p>

<p>Truly Clara Barton belonged to the world, and a suffering
person had no race or creed to her&mdash;she loved and cared for
all.</p>

<p>When at last she returned to America, it was with the determination
to have America sign the Geneva Treaty and
to bring her own country into line with the Red Cross
movement, which she had carefully watched in foreign countries,
and which she saw was the solution to efficient aid of
wounded men, either in the battle-field or wherever there
had been any kind of disaster and there was need of quick
aid for suffering. It was no easy task to convince American
officials, but at last she achieved her end. On the 1st of
March, 1882, the Geneva Treaty was signed by President
Arthur, ratified by the Senate, and immediately the American
National Red Cross was formed with Clara Barton as
its first president.</p>

<p>The European "rest" trip had resulted in one of the
greatest achievements for the benefit of mankind in which
America ever participated, and its birth in the United States
was due solely to the efforts of the determined, consecrated
nurse who, when eleven years old, gave her all to a sick
brother, and later consecrated her life to the service of a
sick brotherhood of brave men.</p>

<p>On the day after her death, on April 12, 1912, one
editor of an American newspaper paid a tribute to her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
that ranks with those paid the world's greatest heroes.
He said:</p>

<p>"On the battle-fields of the Rebellion her hands bound up
the wounds of the injured brave.</p>

<p>"The candles of her charity lighted the gloom of death
for the heroes of Antietam and Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>"Across the ocean waters of her sweet labors followed the
flag of the saintly Red Cross through the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<p>"When stricken Armenia cried out for help in 1896, it was
Clara Barton who led the relief corps of salvation and
sustenance.</p>

<p>"A woman leading in answering the responsibility of civilization
to the world!</p>

<p>"When McKinley's khaki boys struck the iron from
Cuba's bondage it was Clara Barton, in her seventy-seventh
year, who followed to the fever-ridden tropics to lead in the
relief-work on Spanish battle-grounds.</p>

<p>"She is known wherever man appreciates humanity."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Hers was the honor of being the first president of the
American Red Cross, but she was more than that&mdash;she
<i>was</i> the Red Cross at that time. It was, as she said, "her
child," and she furnished headquarters for it in her Washington
home, dispensing the charities of a nation, amounting
to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and was never requested
to publish her accounts, an example of personal leadership
which is unparalleled.</p>

<p>In 1897 we find the Red Cross president settled in her home
at Glen Echo, a few miles out of Washington, on a high
slope overlooking the Potomac, and, although it was a Red
Cross center, it was a friendly lodging as well, where its
owner could receive her personal friends. Flags and Red
Cross testimonials from rulers of all nations fluttered from
the walls, among them a beautiful one from the Sultan of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Turkey. Two small crosses of red glass gleamed in the front
windows over the balcony, but above the house the Red
Cross banner floated high, as if to tell the world that "the
banner over us is love." And to Glen Echo, the center of
her beloved activity, Clara Barton always loved to return
at the end of her campaigns. To the many thousands who
came to visit her home as one of the great humane centers
of the world, she became known as the "Beautiful Lady of
the Potomac," and never did a title more fittingly describe
a nature.</p>

<p>To the last she was a soldier&mdash;systematic, industrious,
severely simple in her tastes. It was a rule of the household
that every day's duties should be disposed of before turning
in for the night, and at five o'clock the next morning she
would be rolling a carpet-sweeper over the floor. She always
observed military order and took a soldier's pride in keeping
her quarters straight.</p>

<p>Hanging on the wall between her bedroom and private
sitting-room was a small mirror into which her mother
looked when she came home as a bride.</p>

<p>Her bed was small and hard. Near it were the books
that meant so much to her&mdash;the Bible, Pilgrim's Progress,
the stories of Sarah Orne Jewett, the poems of Lucy Larcom,
and many other well-worn, much-read classics.</p>

<p>That she was still feminine, as in the days of girlhood
when she fashioned her first straw bonnet, so now she was
fond of wearing handsome gowns, often with trains. Lavender,
royal purple, and wine color were the shades she liked
best to wear, and in which her friends most often remember
her. Despite her few extravagant tastes, Clara Barton was
the most democratic woman America ever produced, as
well as the most humane. She loved people, sick and well,
and in any State and city of the Union she could claim personal
friends in every walk of life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
When, after ninety-nine years of life and fifty of continuous
service to suffering human nature, death laid its hand upon
her on that spring day, the world to its remotest corner
stopped its busy barter and trade for a brief moment to
pay reverent tribute to a woman, who was by nature of
the most retiring, bashful disposition, and yet carried on
her life-work in the face of the enemy, to the sound of cannon,
and close to the firing-line. She was on the firing-line
all her life. That is her life story.</p>

<p>Her "boys" of all ages adored her, and no more touching
incident is told of her than that of a day in Boston, when, after
a meeting, she lingered at its close to chat with General
Shafter. Suddenly the great audience, composed entirely of
old soldiers, rose to their feet as she came down the aisle,
and a voice cried:</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Clara Barton!"</p>

<p>They were given by voices hoarse with feeling. Then
some one shouted:</p>

<p>"Tiger!"</p>

<p>Before it could be given another voice cried:</p>

<p>"No! <i>Sweetheart!</i>"</p>

<p>Then those grizzled elderly men whose lives she had helped
to save broke into uproar and tears together, while the
little bent woman smiled back at them with a love as true
as any sweetheart's.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To-day we stand at the parting of the ways. Our nation
is in the making as a world power, and in its rebirth there
must needs be bloodshed and scalding tears. As we American
girls and women go out bravely to face the untried
future and to nurse under the banner of the Red Cross, we
shall do our best work when we bear to the battle-field the
same spirit of high purpose and consecration that inspired
Clara Barton and made her the "Angel of the Battle-fields."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Let us, as loyal Americans, take to heart part of a speech
she once made on Memorial Day, when she stood with the
"Boys in Blue" in the "God's-acre" of the soldier, and
declared:</p>

<p>"We cannot always hold our great ship of state out of the
storms and breakers. She must meet and buffet with them.
Her timbers must creak in the gale. The waves must wash
over her decks, she must lie in the trough of the sea as she
does to-day. But the Stars and Stripes are above her. She
is freighted with the hopes of the world. God holds the
helm, and she's coming to port. The weak must fear, the
timid tremble, but the brave and stout of heart will work
and hope and trust."</p>

<h2>VIRGINIA REED: MIDNIGHT HEROINE OF THE
PLAINS IN PIONEER DAYS OF AMERICA</h2>


<p>On a lovely April morning in 1846 there was an unusual
stir in the streets of Springfield, Illinois, for such an
early hour. From almost every house some one was hurrying,
and as neighbor nodded to neighbor the news passed on:</p>

<p>"The wagons are ready&mdash;they are going!"</p>

<p>As the sun mounted slowly in the cloudless sky, from all
parts of town there still flocked friends and relatives of the
small band of emigrants who were about to start on their
long trip across the plains, going to golden California.</p>

<p>California&mdash;magic word! Not one of those who were
hurrying to wish the travelers God-speed, nor any of the
band who were leaving their homes, but felt the thrilling
promise and the presage of that new country toward which
the emigrants were about to turn their faces.</p>

<p>The crowd of friends gathered at the Reeds' home, where
their great prairie-wagons and those of the Donners were
drawn up in a long line before the door; the provision
wagons, filled to overflowing with necessities and luxuries,
the family wagons waiting for their human freight. Mr.
James F. Reed, who had planned the trip, was one of Springfield's
most highly respected citizens, and the Donner
brothers, who lived just outside of the town, had enthusiastically
joined him in perfecting the details of the journey,
and had come in to town the night before, with their families,
to be ready for an early start. And now they were really
going!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
All through the previous winter, in the evening, when the
Reeds were gathered before their big log fire, they had talked
of the wonderful adventure, while Mrs. Reed's skilful fingers
fashioned such garments as would be needed for the journey.
And while she sewed, Grandma Keyes told the children marvelous
tales of Indian massacres on those very plains across
which they were going to travel when warmer days came.
Grandma told her breathless audience of giant red men,
whose tomahawks were always ready to descend on the
heads of unlucky travelers who crossed their path&mdash;told so
many blood-curdling stories of meetings between white
men and Indian warriors that the little boys, James and
Thomas, and little black-eyed Patty and older Virginia,
were spellbound as they listened.</p>

<p>To Virginia, an imaginative girl, twelve years old, the very
flames, tongueing their way up the chimney in fantastic
shapes, became bold warriors in mortal combat with emigrants
on their way to the golden West, and even after she
had gone to bed it seemed to her that "everything in the
room, from the high old-fashioned bedposts down to the
shovel and tongs, was transformed into the dusky tribe in
paint and feathers, all ready for a war-dance" as they
loomed large out of shadowy corners. She would hide her
head under the clothes, scarcely daring to wink or breathe,
then come boldly to the surface, face her shadowy foes, and
fall asleep without having come to harm at the hands of the
invisibles.</p>

<p>Going to California&mdash;oh the ecstatic terror of it! And
now the day and the hour of departure had come!</p>

<p>The Reeds' wagons had all been made to order, and carefully
planned by Mr. Reed himself with a view to comfort in
every detail, so they were the best of their kind that ever
crossed the plains, and especially was their family wagon a
real pioneer <i>car de luxe</i>, made to give every possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
convenience to Mrs. Reed and Grandma Keyes. When the
trip had been first discussed by the Reeds, the old lady, then
seventy-five years old and for the most part confined to her
bed, showed such enthusiasm that her son declared, laughingly:
"I declare, mother, one would think you were going
with us."</p>

<p>"I am!" was the quick rejoinder. "You do not think I am
going to be left behind when my dear daughter and her
children are going to take such a journey as that, do you?
I thought you had more sense, James!"</p>

<p>And Grandma did go, despite her years and her infirmities.</p>

<p>The Reeds' family wagon was drawn by four yoke of fine
oxen, and their provision wagons by three. They had also
cows, and a number of driving and saddle horses, among
them Virginia's pony Billy, on whose back she had been held
and taught to ride when she was only seven years old.</p>

<p>The provision wagons were filled to overflowing with all
sorts of supplies. There were farming implements, to be
used in tilling the land in that new country to which they
were going, and a bountiful supply of seeds. Besides these
farm supplies, there were bolts of cotton prints and flannel
for dresses and shirts, also gay handkerchiefs, beads, and
other trinkets to be used for barter with the Indians. More
important still, carefully stowed away was a store of fine
laces, rich silks and velvets, muslins and brocades, to be
exchanged for Mexican land-grants. The family wagon,
too, had been fitted up with every kind of commodity, including
a cooking-stove, with its smoke-stack carried out
through the canvas roof of the wagon, and a looking-glass
which Mrs. Reed's friends had hung on the canvas wall
opposite the wagon door&mdash;"so you will not forget to keep
your good looks, they said!"</p>

<p>And now the party was ready to start. Among its number
were Mrs. Reed and her husband, with little Patty, the two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
small boys, James and Thomas, and the older daughter, Virginia;
the Donners, George and Jacob, with their wives and
children; Milton Elliott, driver of the Reed family wagon,
who had worked for years in Mr. Reed's big sawmill;
Eliza Baylis, the Reeds' domestic, with her brother and a
number of other young men, some of them drivers, others
merely going for adventure. In all, on that lovely April
morning, it was a group of thirty-one persons around whom
friends and relatives clustered for last words and glimpses,
and it was a sad moment for all. Mrs. Reed broke down
when she realized that the moment of parting had really
come, while Mr. Reed, in response to the good wishes showered
on him, silently gripped hand after hand, then he hurried
into the house with Milt Elliott, and presently came out
carrying Grandma, at the sight of whom her friends cheered
lustily. She waved her thin hand in response as she was
lifted gently into the wagon and placed on a large feather-bed,
where she was propped up with pillows and declared
herself to be perfectly comfortable.</p>

<p>And indeed her resting-place was very much like a room,
for the wagon had been built with its entrance at the side,
like an old-fashioned stage-coach, and from the door one
stepped into a small square room. At the right and left were
spring seats with high backs, which were comfortable for
riding, and over the wheels for the length of the wagon, a
wide board had been placed, making what Virginia called a
"really truly second story" on which beds were made up.
Under this "second story" were roomy compartments in
which were stowed away stout bags holding the clothing of
the party, each bag plainly marked with a name. There
was also a full supply of medicines, with lint and bandages
for an emergency, and Mr. Reed had provided a good library
of standard books, not only to read during the journey,
but knowing they could not be bought in the new West.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Altogether, from provision wagon to family caravan, there
was a complete equipment for every need, and yet when they
arrived in California, as one of the party said, "We were
almost destitute of everything!"</p>

<p>The wagons were loaded, Grandma was safely stowed away
in her warm bed, with little Patty sitting on its end where
she could hold back the door flap that the old lady might
have a last glimpse of her old home&mdash;the hard farewells had
been said, and now Mr. Reed called in as cheery a voice as he
could command, "All aboard!"</p>

<p>Milton Elliott cracked his whip, and the long line of
prairie-wagons, horses and cattle started. Then came a
happy surprise. Into saddles and vehicles sprang more
than a score of friends and relatives who were going to follow
the party to their first night's encampment, while many of
Virginia's schoolmates ran at the side of the wagon through
the principal streets of the town until one by one they
dropped back from fatigue, Virginia waving a continued
farewell from the wagon while they were in sight.</p>

<p>The first day's trip was not a long one, as it was thought
wise to make the start easy for man and beast. Most of
the way Virginia rode on Billy, sometimes beside the wagon,
then again galloping ahead with her father. A bridge was
seen in the distance, and Patty and the boys cried out to
Milton, "Please stop, and let us get out and walk over it; the
oxen may not take us across safely!" Milt threw back his
head and roared with laughter at such an idea, but he halted
to humor them, then with a skilful use of his loud-voiced
"Gee! and Haw!" made the huge beasts obey his will.</p>

<p>On the line of great wagons wound its way beyond the
town, until the sun was sinking in the west, when they
stopped for the night on the ground where the Illinois State
House now stands. The oxen were then unhitched and the
wagons drawn up in a hollow circle or "corral," within the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
protection of which cattle and horses were set free for the
night, while outside the corral a huge camp-fire soon blazed,
around which the party gathered for their first evening meal
together, and their last one with those friends who had come
thus far on their way with them. It was a determinedly
merry group around the fire, and stories were told and songs
sung, which to the radiant Virginia were a foretaste of such
coming adventure as was beyond her wildest dreams.</p>

<p>As she sat in the glow of the camp-fire, with sleepy Patty's
head pillowed on her lap, she felt even more than before the
thrill of this wonderful adventuring. To keep a record of
her travels,&mdash;that was the thing to do! Full of the idea,
she pinned together sheets of wrapping-paper into a bulky
blank-book, on the outside of which she printed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Going to California. 1846.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From that time she kept a faithful though not a continuous
record of the experiences of what came to be known later as
"the ill-fated Donner party of martyr pioneers." And
from that record she later wrote her story of their journeying
to the golden West.</p>

<p>By the eleventh day of May the band of emigrants had
reached the town of Independence, Missouri, and Virginia's
record says:</p>

<p>"Men and beasts are in fine condition. There is nothing
in all the world so fascinating as to travel by day in the warm
sunshine and to camp by night under the stars. Here we
are just outside the most bustling town I ever saw and it is
good news to find a large number of inhabitants with their
wagons, ready to cross the prairie with us. Who knows,
perhaps some new friendships will be made as we all go on
together! They all seem to feel as eager to go as we are, and
everybody is glad. I will get acquainted with as many as I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
can now, and bring cheerful ones to visit Grandma, for she
feels rather homesick, except when Patty and I make her
laugh."</p>

<p>Again, "The first few days of travel through the Territory
of Kansas were lovely. The flowers were so bright and
there were so many birds singing. Each day father and I
would ride ahead to find a place to camp that night. Sometimes
when we galloped back we would find the wagons
halting at a creek, while washing was done or the young
people took a swim. Mother and I always did our wash at
night, and spread it on the bushes to dry. All this is such a
peaceful recital that I began to think I need not keep a diary
at all, till one hot day when I was in the wagon helping Patty
cut out some doll's dresses, Jim came running up to the
wagon, terribly excited and crying out:</p>

<p>"'Indians, Virginia! Come and see! They have to take
us across the river!' Out he rushed and I after him, with
every story Grandma ever told us dancing through my
brain. Now there was going to be an adventure! But
there wasn't. We had reached the Caw River, where there
were Indians to ferry us across. They were real and red
and terrifying, but I never flinched. If they brought out
tomahawks in midstream, I would be as brave as a pioneer's
daughter should be. But would you believe me, those
Indians were as tame as pet canaries, and just shot us across
the river without glancing at us, and held out their big hands
with a grunt, for the coins! That was one of the greatest
disappointments of my life."</p>

<p>All went well with the travelers during those first weeks of
the trip, and no one enjoyed it more than Grandma Keyes
after she got over being homesick. But when they reached
the Big Blue river, it was so swollen that they had to lie by
and wait for it to go down, or make rafts to cross it on. As
soon as they stopped traveling Grandma began to fail,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and on the 29th of May, with scarcely any pain, she died.
Virginia's diary says: "It was hard to comfort mother until
I persuaded her that to die out in that lovely country, and
with most of your family around you, was far better than
living longer at home. Besides, she might have died in
Springfield. So mother cheered up a little, while all the
party helped us in making the sad preparations. A coffin
was made from a cotton-wood tree, and a young man from
home found a gray stone slab and cut Grandma's name,
birthplace, and age on it. A minister of the party made a
simple address, and with the sunlight filtering through the
trees we buried her under an oak-tree and covered the grave
with wild flowers. Then we had to go on our way and leave
dear Grandma in the vast wilderness, which was so hard for
mother that for many days I did not take my rides on Billy,
but just stayed with her. But the landscape was so comfortingly
beautiful that at last she cheered up and began to feel
that Grandma was not left alone in the forest, but was with
God. Strange to say, that grave in the woods has never
been disturbed; around it grew up the city of Manhattan,
Kansas, and there it is in the city cemetery of to-day."</p>

<p>The river did not go down, as the men had hoped, so they
began to cut down trees and split them into twenty-five-foot
logs which were hollowed out and joined together by cross
timbers, these were firmly lashed to stakes driven into the
bank, and ropes were tied to each end to pull the rafts back
and forth across the river. It was no easy matter to get the
heavy wagons down the steep bank to the rafts, and they
had to be held back by the ropes and let down slowly so the
wheels would run into the hollowed logs. The women and
children stayed in the wagons, and talked and laughed gaily,
that they might not show the fear they felt as they balanced
above the swollen river. But it was crossed safely and then
on the oxen jogged over a rough road until the great Valley
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of the Platte was reached, where the road was good and the
country beautiful beyond expression. Virginia says: "Our
party was now so large that there was a line of forty wagons
winding its way like a serpent through the valley. There
was no danger of any kind, and each day was happier than
the one before. How I enjoyed galloping over the plains on
Billy!" she exclaims, adding, "At night we young folks
would sit around the camp-fire, chatting merrily, and often a
song would be heard, or some clever dancer would give us a
barn-door jig on the hind gate of a wagon!"</p>

<p>The caravan wound its slow way westward, making from
fifteen to twenty miles a day, and always at night, when the
party camped, a corral was formed to protect the cattle from
thieving Indians, who, says Virginia, sadly, "are not like
grandma's Indians. They treat us kindly except for taking
our things, which is annoying but not terrifying." And she
adds, "We have fine fare for those who like to eat game, as
we have so many good riflemen in the party who are always
bringing it in." She then confesses, "I certainly never
thought I would be relishing antelope and buffalo steaks,
but they are good food when one has grown used to them.
Often I ride with father in a buffalo hunt, which is very
thrilling. We all help Eliza, who has turned into a fine camp
cook. As soon as we reach the place where we are to spend
the night all hands get to work, and, my, but things taste
good when that meal is ready! When we drove into the
South Fork of the Platte, Eliza had the cream ready to churn,
and while we were fording the stream she worked so hard that
she turned out several pounds of butter."</p>

<p>The diary gives quite a long narrative here as follows:</p>

<p>"By the Fourth of July we were near Fort Laramie in
Dakota, and what a sight I saw as we approached the fort.
'Grandma's Indians!' I exclaimed, as I saw bands of horses
grazing on the plains and Indians smeared with war-paint
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and armed with hunting-knives, tomahawks, bows and
arrows, moving about in the sunlight. They did not seem to
notice us as we drove up to the strongly fortified walls
around the buildings of the American Fur Company, but by
the time we were ready to leave, the red men and their
squaws were pressing close to the wagons to take trinkets
which we had ready for them. Little Patty stood by me
and every now and then she squeezed my arm and cried,
'Look! Look!' as the Indians crowded around us. Many of
the squaws and papooses were gorgeous in white doeskin
suits gaily trimmed with beads, and were very different from
us in our linsey dresses and sunbonnets.</p>

<p>"As soon as father met the manager of the Fur Company,
he advised us to go right on as soon as we could, because he
said the Sioux were on the war-path, going to fight the Crows
or Blackfeet, and their march would be through the country
which we had to cross, and they might treat us badly, or rob
us, as they were in an ugly humor. This greatly frightened
some of the women, and to calm them the men cleaned and
loaded their rifles and did everything they could to hurry
away from the fort. We were there only four days, and
when we drove away we met the mounted Indians, about
three hundred of them, tomahawks, war-paint, and all!
They looked very handsome and impressive as they advanced
in a stately procession, two abreast, and rode on before our
train, then halted and opened ranks. As our wagons passed
between their lines they took green twigs from between their
teeth and tossed them to us in token of friendship. Then,
having shown their good faith, they crowded around our
wagons and showed great curiosity at the funny little smoke-stack
sticking through the top of our family wagon. A brave
caught a glimpse of his war-paint and feathers in our looking-glass,
which hung opposite the door, and he was fascinated.
Beckoning to his comrades, he pointed to it, and to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
strange reflection of himself, and they all fairly pushed to
the front, to see themselves, in the glass. Unfortunately at
that time I rode up on Billy, and at once the Indians forgot
everything except their admiration of my pony. They
swarmed around me, grunting, nodding, and gesturing, and
brought buffalo robes and tanned buckskin, also pretty
beaded moccasins and robes made of grass, and signed to me
that they would give all these in exchange for Billy. I
shook my head as hard as I could shake it, but they were
determined to have Billy. They made signs that they
would give their ponies for mine, but again I shook my head.
They talked together awhile, then one of them triumphantly
brought me an old coat which had evidently belonged to a
soldier, and seemed much surprised that its brass buttons
were not enough of an inducement to make me give up the
coveted prize. Though both father and I continued to
refuse their request as positively as ever, they still swarmed
around us and looked at me in a most embarrassing way. I
did not mind much, but father seemed angry and he said,
sternly: 'Virginia, you dismount at once and let one of the
men take Billy. Get into the wagon now.' When father
spoke in that way I was never slow to obey, so I climbed
into the wagon, and, being anxious to get a better look at the
Indians, I took a field-glass out of the rack where it hung and
put it to my eyes. The glass clicked as I took it from the
rack and like a flash the Indians wheeled their ponies and
scattered, taking the noise for the click of firearms. I turned
to mother and laughed.</p>

<p>"'You see you need not be afraid, mother dear,' I said;
'I can fight the whole Sioux tribe with a spy-glass! If they
come near the wagon again just watch me take it up and see
them run!'"</p>

<p>Those were happy days of adventuring in a new and
smiling country, and all were in high spirits when on the 19th
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of July they reached the Little Sandy River, where
they encamped, and all gathered together to talk over
whether to take a new route which had been opened up by
Mr. Lansford Hastings, called the Hastings Cut-off. This
route passed along the southern shore of the Great Salt
Lake, then joined the Old Fort Hall emigrant road on the
Humboldt River. The new route was said to shorten the
trip by about three hundred miles, and Virginia says in her
diary, "Father was so eager to reach California quickly, that
he was strongly in favor of taking the Cut-off, while others
were equally firm in their objections to taking such a risk.
At that time our party had grown to be a large one, for so
many families had joined us on our way across the plains,
and all had to have their say about the matter.</p>

<p>"There was a long discussion of the merits of the two
routes, and as a result, at last we decided to split up, for a
number of the party preferred not to risk taking the new
route, while eighty-seven of us, including our family and the
Donners, decided to take the Cut-off.</p>

<p>"On the 20th of July we broke camp and left the little
Sandy, the other division of the party taking the old trail
to Fort Hall, and the rest of us, who were called 'the Donner
party' from that time, taking the new one.</p>

<p>"When we reached Fort Bridger, we were told that Mr.
Hastings, whom we had expected to find there, had gone
ahead to pilot a large emigrant train, and had left word that
all later bands were to follow his trail; that they would find
an abundant supply of wood, water, and pasturage along the
whole line of road except for one forty-mile drive; that there
were no difficult ca&ntilde;ons to pass; and that the road was mostly
good. This was encouraging and we traveled on comfortably
for a week, when we reached the spot where Webber
River breaks through the mountains into a ca&ntilde;on. There,
by the side of the road, was a forked branch with a note
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
stuck in its cleft, left by Hastings, saying, 'I advise all parties
to encamp and wait for my return. The road I have
taken is so rough that I fear wagons will not be able to get
through to the Great Salt Lake Valley.' He mentioned
another and better route which avoided the ca&ntilde;on altogether,
and at once father, Mr. Stanton and William Pike
said they would go ahead over this road, and if possible meet
Hastings and bring him back to pilot us through to the
valley.</p>

<p>"While the men went off to try to find Hastings, we encamped
and waited for them to come back. In five days
father came alone, having become separated from his companions,
who he feared might have been lost. They had
met Hastings, but he had refused to leave his party for their
sake. Finally, however, father had insisted that he go with
them to a high peak of the Wahsatch Mountains and from
there point out to them the direction our party ought to take.
Coming down from the peak, father lost sight of Stanton
and Pike and was forced to come on alone, taking notes and
blazing trees to help him in retracing his path when he should
have us to guide. Searchers were at once sent out after the
lost men, while we broke camp and started on our risky
journey. It was easy enough traveling at first, but the following
day we were brought to a sudden stop by a patch of
dense woodland which it took a whole day's chopping to
open up enough for our wagons to pass through. From
there we chopped and pushed our way through what seemed
an impassable wilderness of high peaks and rock-bound
ca&ntilde;ons, and then faced a great rough gulch. Believing it
would lead out to the valley, our men again set to work
vigorously, and for six long days they chopped until they
were almost exhausted. Then a new party of emigrants
caught up with us and, aided by three fresh men, the eight-mile
road through the gulch was finished. It did not lead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to the opening we had expected, but into a pretty mountain
dell, but we were happy, because we found the searchers
there with Mr. Stanton and Mr. Pike. They reported that
we must go back on the newly made road and cross a more
distant range of mountains in order to strike the trail to the
valley. That was a moment of terror, even to the most
courageous of our valiant band, but everyone forced a smile
and a cheerful word as we started to retrace our way. We
had five days more of traveling and road-making, and
climbed a mountain so steep that six yoke of oxen had to pull
each wagon up the steep ascent. Then we crossed the river
flowing from Utah Lake to Great Salt Lake and at last
found the trail of the Hastings party, thirty days after we
set out for the point we had expected to reach in ten or
twelve days.</p>

<p>"While we rested we took an inventory of our provisions,
and found the supply was not sufficient to last until we
should reach California. Here was a predicament! Mr.
Donner called for volunteers to ride ahead on horseback to
Sutter's Fort, to tell of our sorry plight and ask Captain Sutter
to send back provisions by them for us, as we traveled
toward them. Mr. Stanton and Mr. McCutchen said they
would go to the fort, and rode away on their errand of mercy.</p>

<p>"Our wagons, meanwhile, wound their slow way along, far
behind the horsemen, who were soon out of our sight, and
two days later we found a lovely green valley where there
were twenty wells of clear, sparkling water to cool our
parched throats, which were only used to the alkaline pools
from which we had been obliged to drink. Close beside the
largest well we found a rough board, stuck in the ground
with strips of white paper pinned to it, and around the board
pieces of the paper were strewn on the turf, as if they had
been torn off the board. 'There has been some message
written on that paper. We must piece the bits together,'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
declared Mrs. Donner. No sooner said than done. Laying
the board on her lap, she began to patch the scraps together,
while we eagerly watched her. At last the words could be
read: '2 days&mdash;2 nights&mdash;hard driving&mdash;cross&mdash;desert&mdash;reach
water.' This was evidently meant as a warning to us,
and the thought of two days' hard driving through the desert
was anything but cheering. In fact, it would be such a strain
on our cattle that we remained where we were, with the fine
water to drink and good pasturage for three days. Then we
filled our water casks, made all other preparations for the
forty-mile drive, and started off again. We traveled for
two days and nights, suffering from heat and thirst by day
and from bitter cold by night. At the end of the second day
we still saw the vast desert ahead of us as far as we could
look. There was no more fodder for our cattle, our water-casks
were empty, and the burning rays of the sun scorched
us with pitiless and overpowering heat. Father rode on
ahead in search of water, and scarcely had he left us than
our beasts began to drop from exhaustion and thirst. Their
drivers instantly unhitched them and drove them ahead,
hoping to meet father and find wells where the thirsty
beasts could be refreshed. They did find father and he
showed them the way to wells he had found where the beasts
could drink, then he traveled back to us, reaching our camp
at dawn. We waited all that day in the desert, with the sun
beating down on us with cruel heat, and still drivers and
cattle had not come back. It was a desperate plight, for
another night without water would mean death. We must
set out on foot and try to reach some of the other wagons,
whose owners had gone ahead." Virginia adds, "Never
shall I forget that night, when we walked mile after mile in
the darkness, every step seeming to be the very last we could
take, each of us who were older and stronger, taking turns
in carrying the younger children. Suddenly out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
black night came a swift, rushing noise of one of the young
steers, who was crazed by thirst and rushing madly toward
us. Father snatched up little Patty, and commanded the
rest of us to keep close to his side, while he drew his pistol.
We could hear the heavy snorting of the maddened beast,
when he turned and dashed off into the darkness, leaving
us weak and shivering with fright and relief. And still we
were obliged to drag our weary feet on, for ten long miles,
when we reached the Jacob Donner wagons. The family
were all asleep inside, so we lay down on the ground under
the protecting shadow of the family wagon. A bitter wind
was howling across the desert, and it so chilled us that we
crept close together, and if all five of our dogs had not
snuggled up close to us, warming us with the heat from their
big bodies, we would probably had died from cold.</p>

<p>"At dawn father rushed off to find his cattle, but in vain.
He met the drivers, who told him that as the frenzied beasts
were being driven toward the wells, they had broken loose
and been lost in the darkness. At once all the men of the
company turned out to help father to search for them, but
none were ever found except one ox and a cow, and in that
plight we were left stranded on the desert, eight hundred
miles from California! To turn back to Fort Bridger was an
impossibility&mdash;to go forward meant such hardship as
blanched even my sun-reddened cheeks, and I shuddered at
the thought that mother must live through greater privations
than those we had already encountered. Well it was
that the future was hidden from our eyes on that day in the
desert!</p>

<p>"Two oxen were loaned father, which, yoked together with
our one cow and ox, would draw one wagon, but not the
family one, which had grown to be so home-like to us in our
journeyings. It was decided to dig a trench, and <i>cache</i> all
of our things except those which we could take in the one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
wagon. A <i>cache</i> is made by digging a hole in the ground and
sinking in it the bed of a wagon, in which articles are packed;
the hole is then covered with boards and earth, so they are
completely hidden, and when we buried ours we hoped some
day to return and take them away."</p>

<p>Having <i>cached</i> so many of their treasures, on the party went
as bravely as possible until they reached Gravelly Ford on
the Humboldt, where on the 5th of October there was such
a tragic occurrence that Virginia says, "I grew up into a
woman in a night, and life was never the same again, although
for the sake of mother and the children I hid my
feelings as well as I could."</p>

<p>Here her record is detailed, and as concise as possible.
She writes:</p>

<p>"I will tell it as clearly and quickly as I can. We had
reached a short sandy hill, and as the oxen were all tired, it was
the custom at such places for the drivers to double up teams
and help one another up the hill. A driver named Snyder,
for some unaccountable reason, decided to go up alone. His
oxen could not pull their load, and Snyder, angry at them,
began to beat them. Father, who had gone on ahead, looking
for the best road, came back, and in trying to make Snyder
stop abusing his beasts, roused his anger to the point of
frenzy. Father said, 'We can settle this, John, when we
get up the hill.' 'No,' said Snyder. 'We will settle it
now!' and, jumping on the tongue of his wagon, he struck
father a hard blow over the head with his heavy whip-stock.
One blow followed another, and father was stunned, as well
as blinded by the blood streaming down from the gashes in
his head. The whip was about to drop again when mother
sprang between the two men. Father saw the uplifted
whip and had only time to cry 'John! John!' when down
came the blow on mother's head. Quick as a flash father's
hunting-knife was out and Snyder fell, mortally wounded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and fifteen minutes later died. Then father realized, too
late, what he had done. Dashing the blood from his eyes,
he knelt over the dying man, who had been his friend, with
remorse and agony in his expression.</p>

<p>"Camp was pitched at once, our wagon being some distance
from the others, and father, whose head was badly
cut, came to me.</p>

<p>"'Daughter,' he asked, 'do you think you can dress these
wounds in my head? Your mother is not able and they
must be attended to.' I said, promptly: 'Yes, if you will
tell me what to do.' Then we went into the wagon, where
we would not be disturbed, and I washed and dressed his
wounds as best I could. When I had done what he told me
to do, I burst out crying, and father clasped me in his arms,
saying: 'I should not have asked so much of you!' I told
him it was pity for him that made me cry. Then he talked
to me quietly until I had controlled my feelings and was able
to go back to the tent where mother was lying, weak and
dazed by the happenings of the day. And there were worse
things to come. In our party there was a man who had
been in the habit of beating his wife until father told him he
must either stop it or measures would be taken to make him.
He did not dare abuse her again, but he hated father from
that time, and now he had his chance for revenge. After
Snyder had been buried, and father had sadly watched the
last clod of earth piled on the grave, the men of the party
held a conference from which our family were excluded.
We waited a short distance away, in terrified suspense to
know the outcome of it, as we were sure it concerned father.
And it did. His plea of self-defense was not acceptable to
them, they said, and we shivered as we saw such bitterness
on the men's faces as seemed sure would lead to lynching.
Father saw it, but he was no coward. Baring his neck, he
stepped forward, and proudly said, 'Come on, gentlemen!'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
No one moved, and presently he was told that he must
leave the party, an exile&mdash;must go out in the wilderness alone
without food or weapons. It was a cruel sentence, for it
might result either in starvation or in murder by the Indians,
and it is no wonder that mother was beside herself with
fright, that we children knew not what to do or where to turn
for help. Father heard the sentence in silence, then facing
the group of old-time friends, with brave eyes, he said:
'I will not go. My act was one of self-defense, and as such
is justified before God and man.'</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, my mother had been thinking, as she told me
later, and she begged father to accept the sentence and leave
the party, thinking it would be less dangerous than to remain
among men who had become his enemies. He firmly
refused until she pleaded that the whole party were now
practically destitute of food, and if he remained, as an outcast,
he would be obliged to see his children starve, while by
going he might be able to meet them with food which he
had procured somewhere. After a fearful struggle with his
own desires, father consented, but not until the men of the
party had promised to care for his innocent wife and children.
Then, after he had held mother in his arms for a long
agonized moment, he turned to me, and I forced my eyes to
meet his with such fearless trust that he looked less despairing
as he picked up Patty for a last hug and gripped the boys
with an emotion too deep for any words; then he went off, an
exile in the desert.</p>

<p>"I had no idea what I was going to do about it, but I knew
I must do something. Through the long hours of the day,
while I was busy soothing and comforting mother, who felt
it keenly that we were left as much alone as if we were lepers,
I was thinking busily. Our wagon was drawn up apart
from the others, and we ate our scanty evening meal in
silence. Milt Elliott and some others tried to talk with us,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and show their friendliness, but mother would only answer
in monosyllables and commanded the children to do the
same. We were an utterly desolate, frightened group as
darkness fell over us. I was busy helping the children get
to bed, and then I found mother in such a state of collapse
that I could think of nothing but comforting and quieting
her.</p>

<p>"At last she fell asleep, and I crept to my bed, but I could
not sleep. I must act. At last, I made a decision. I was
strong and fearless, and father had no food or light or supplies,
out there alone in the trackless wilderness. I stole
to my mother's side and she roused at my light touch.</p>

<p>"'Mother, dear,' I whispered, 'I am going out to find
father and take him some food, and his gun, and ammunition.'
She roused and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'What do you mean, child? You cannot find your
father!'</p>

<p>"'I'm not going alone,' I replied 'I've asked Milt and he
says he'll go with me.'</p>

<p>"Without giving her a chance to say I must not go, I hurried
to the supply-chest and found some crackers, a small
piece of bacon, some coffee and sugar. I took a tin cup, too,
and a dipper for father to make coffee in, and packed his
gun, pistols, and ammunition with them. His lantern was
on the shelf, and I put a fresh piece of candle in it and
matches in my pocket&mdash;then I was ready to start.</p>

<p>"Everything had to be done very quickly and quietly, for
there would be a great risk if the children knew what I was
going to do, or if any others of the party discovered my intention.
So I did everything on tip-toe, and holding my
breath for fear of being discovered.</p>

<p>"Mother called, 'Virginia!' and I went to her side. 'How
will you find him in the darkness?'</p>

<p>"'I shall look for his horse's tracks and follow them,' I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
whispered. At that moment Milton's cautious step was
heard at the side of the wagon, and with a last hug mother
released me, and Milt and I stole off on our dangerous
expedition.</p>

<p>"Out into the darkness we crept. Stealthily we hid in the
shadows cast by the wagons in the flickering light of the
dying camp-fire&mdash;cautiously we stole up behind the unsuspicious
sentinel who was wearily tramping back and forth,
and we held our breath for fright as he suddenly looked over
the sleeping camp, then peered out into the mysterious
darkness of the desert, but he did not see us. For safety we
lay down on the ground, and silently dragged our bodies
along until we were well out of his sight and hearing; then
we pushed our feet along without lifting them, to be sure
they did not fall into some unseen hole or trap, and now and
again we were startled by some noise that to our excited
senses seemed to mean that a wild animal was near us.
My eyes had been searching the darkness around and before
us, and at last I whispered:</p>

<p>"'Stop, Milt. Let us light the lantern!'</p>

<p>"Then stooping down, I spread out my skirts so that not
the slightest flash of a match or gleam of light could be seen
by the sentinel or by any one in the encampment. Milton
lighted the lantern. I took it in one hand, and with the
other held my skirts up in such a way as to shield its beams,
and in its feeble light I searched the ground still frantically
for some trace of the footprints of father's horse. Although
I was nervous and excited enough to fly on the wings of
lightning, I did not let the feeling get the better of me, but
made a deliberate search of every inch of ground, making a
complete circle around the outskirts of the camp, for I was
determined to find those tracks. At last! There they
were, unmistakable and clear. I gave a smothered cry and
showed them to Milt. Then, still with the lantern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
carefully covered, so that no unguarded flash might bring a
death-dealing shot from the sentinel's rifle, I followed
where they led, Milt close behind, carrying the gun and
provisions. Mile after mile we followed&mdash;followed, now
seeing the tracks, now losing them. Oh what an agony
was compressed in those awful hours!</p>

<p>"Suddenly on the midnight air came the wild howl of coyotes.
From the distance echoed an even more hideous cry&mdash;that
of the panther, seeking for prey. At that sound
Milton's hair literally stood on end, and if I had shown one
sign of weakening he would gladly have given up the search.
But I went on, closing my ears to the dreaded sounds. All
of a sudden my heart beat so wildly that I was obliged to
press my hand over it to quiet its hammering. What I
heard or saw or felt I can never explain, but I know that all
the terror of my thirteen years of life seemed to be condensed
into one moment of dread. And yet go on I must, praying
to God to protect us and let me find father. I pushed
ahead, with panic holding me in its wild grip as I pictured a
horrible death if we should be captured by Indians. Then
suddenly with wide-strained eyes and fluttering heart, I
forgot all weariness and fear. In the far distance a dim,
flickering light. Gripping Milt's arm, I whispered:</p>

<p>"'Father!'</p>

<p>"No sooner had I said it than I thought, 'Perhaps it is an
Indian camp-fire.' But common sense put that aside, for I
was sure I had seen father's horse's hoofprints, and certainly
they would lead to him. But suppose he had been captured
by Indians, and this fire we were coming to should lead to
horrible disclosures. All this went through my mind, but I
said nothing of it to Milton. I just went walking steadily on.
Oh, how far away the light was! Would we never reach it?
It seemed as if the more we walked the farther from it we
were. But no, it was he&mdash;it was&mdash;it was! With a glad cry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of, 'Oh, father! father!' I rushed forward and flung myself
in his arms.</p>

<p>"'My child, my Virginia!' he exclaimed, when surprise
had let him find his voice. 'You should not have come
here!'</p>

<p>"'But I <i>am</i> here,' I cried, 'and I've brought you some
food and your gun, and a blanket, and a little coffee, and
some crackers! And here's a tin cup, too, and your pistols,
and some powder and caps. Oh, and here are some matches,
too!' I exclaimed, holding out one after another of
the precious articles to his astonished gaze, and laughing and
crying as I talked.</p>

<p>"It was almost pitiful to see father's astonishment at the
thought that some one had come to help him in his terrible
plight, and as he took the things I had brought he kissed
and fondled me like a little child, and said that, God helping
him, he would hurry on to California and secure a home for
his beloved family&mdash;and it seems conceited to mention it,
but he called me his 'brave daughter' over and over again,
until I was glad of the darkness to hide my burning cheeks.
Then in the protecting darkness, with Milton to stand
guard, we sat together and talked of mother and Patty and
the boys, and of what we should do while we were parted
from him. Father was the first to remember that dawn
would soon flush the east, and rising, he kissed me again
and tried to say farewell.</p>

<p>"'But I'm not going back!' I cried. 'I'm going with you.
Milt will go back, but I am going on with you.' Seeing his
stern, set face, I pleaded, piteously: 'Oh, don't send me
back&mdash;I can never bear to see those cruel men again. Let
me go with you?' He turned a white, drawn face to mine.</p>

<p>"'For mother's sake, dear,' he said, 'go back and take
care of her. God will care for me.' Before I could cry out
or make a move to go with him, he had gathered up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
articles I had brought him, jumped on his horse, and ridden
away into the solitude of the Western desert. Milton and I
were left alone to find our way back to the encampment
where mother was watching and waiting for me with an
eager, aching heart. When my straining eyes had seen the
last of that solitary figure riding off into the black desert, I
turned abruptly away, and Milt and I crept back over the
vast desert. Before there was a glimmer of dawn I was
safely clasped in mother's arms, repeated my comforting
news over and over again that we had found father, that he
was well and on his way to that land toward which our own
faces were turned."</p>

<p>In this simple, direct fashion has Virginia Reed told of a
heroic deed in the history of brave pioneer girls&mdash;but as the
story comes from her pen, it is scarcely possible to realize
the anxiety, the torturing fear, the hideous danger of such an
expedition as that one of hers when at midnight, on the great
plains, she set out to find her father.</p>

<p>"After that," she says, "though we were obliged to travel
on, and though the party tried to be friendly with us, our
hearts were sore and our thoughts were centered on father,
journeying on alone. But as we went on we found welcome
surprises by the way. A note written by him, stuck on a
forked twig by the wayside, feathers scattered over the path
to show that he had killed a bird and was not hungry.
When we had found such evidence of his being alive and
well, mother would be light-hearted for a whole day. Then
the signs ceased, and mother's despair was pitiful to see.
Had he been killed by the Indians or perhaps died of
starvation? Patty and I were afraid we would lose mother,
too. But starvation was menacing the whole party, and she
was roused to new strength in a desire to protect her children
from that fate. And even more ominous in their portent of
disaster, before us rose the snow-capped Sierra Nevada
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
mountains, which we must cross before the heavy snows
fell, and the question was, could we do it? We left our
wagon behind, which was too heavy for the mountain trip,
placed in it every article we could do without, packed what
we needed in another, and struggled on as best we could until
the 19th of October, when we had a great joy. As we were
wearily traveling along the Truckee, up rode Mr. Stanton
and with him were seven mules loaded with provisions!
No angel from the skies could have been more welcome, and,
hungry though we were, better than food was the news that
father was alive and pushing on to the west. Mr. Stanton
had met him near Sutter's Fort, and had given him provisions
and a fresh horse. Oh, how relieved mother was! I
think she could not have eaten a mouthful, hungry as she
was, without the glad tidings. Father had asked Mr.
Stanton to personally conduct us across the Sierras before
snow came, which he had promised to do, so with new courage
we hurried on, keeping a close watch on those gaunt
peaks ahead of us, which we must climb before realizing our
dreams. Although it was so early in the season, all trails
were covered with snow, but we struggled on, mother riding
one mule with Tommy in her lap, Patty and Jim on another,
behind two Indians who had accompanied Mr. Stanton, and
I riding behind our leader. But though we did all in our
power to travel fast, we were obliged to call a halt before
we reached the summit, and camp only three miles this side
of the crest of the mountain range.</p>

<p>"That night," says Virginia, "came the dreaded snow.
Around the camp-fires under the trees great feathery flakes
came whirling down. The air was so full of them that one
could see objects only a few feet away. The Indians knew
we were doomed and one of them wrapped his blanket
about him and stood all night under a tree. We children
slept soundly on our cold bed of snow, which fell over us so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
thickly that every few moments my mother would have to
shake the shawl&mdash;our only covering&mdash;to keep us from being
buried alive. In the morning the snow lay deep on mountain
and valley, and we were forced to turn back to a lake we
had passed, which was afterward called 'Donner Lake,'
where the men hastily put up some rough cabins&mdash;three of
them known as the Breen cabin, the Murphy cabin, and the
Reed-Graves cabin. Then the cattle were all killed, and the
meat was placed in the snow to preserve it, and we tried to
settle down as comfortably as we could, until the season of
snow and ice should be over. But the comfort was a poor
imitation of the real thing, and now and then, in desperation,
a party started out to try to cross the mountains, but they
were always driven back by the pitiless storms. Finally, a
party of fifteen, known in later days as the 'Forlorn Hopes,'
started out, ten men and five women, on snow-shoes, led by
noble Mr. Stanton, and we heard no more of them until
months afterward.</p>

<p>"No pen can describe the dreary hopelessness of those
who spent that winter at Donner Lake," says Virginia.
"Our daily life in that dark little cabin under the snow would
fill pages and make the coldest heart ache. Only one
memory stands out with any bright gleam. Christmas was
near, and there was no way of making it a happy time.
But my mother was determined to give us a treat on that
day. She had hidden away a small store of provisions&mdash;a
few dried apples, some beans, a bit of tripe, and a small piece
of bacon. These she brought out, and when we saw the
treasures we shouted for joy, and watched the meal cooking
with hunger-sharpened eyes. Mother smiled at our delight
and cautioned:</p>

<p>"'Children, eat slowly, for this one day you can have all
you wish!' and never has any Christmas feast since driven
out of my memory that most memorable one at Donner Lake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
"Somehow or other the cold dark days and weeks passed,
but as they went by our store of supplies grew less and less,
and many died from cold and hunger. Frequently we had
to cut chips from the inside of our cabin to start a fire, and
we were so weak from want of food that we could scarcely
drag ourselves from one cabin to the other, and so four
dreadful months wore away. Then came a day when a fact
stared us in the face. We were starving. With an almost
superhuman strength mother roused. 'I am going to walk
across the mountains,' she said; 'I cannot see my children
die for lack of food.' Quickly I stood beside her. 'I will
go, too,' I said. Up rose Milt and Eliza. 'We will go
with you,' they said. Leaving the children to be cared for by
the Breens and Murphys, we made a brave start. Milt
led the way on snow-shoes and we followed in his tracks, but
Eliza gave out on the first day and had to go back, and after
five days in the mountains, we, too, turned back and mother
was almost exhausted, and we went back just in time, for
that night there was the most fearful storm of the winter,
and we should have died if we had not had the shelter of our
cabins. My feet had been badly frozen, and mother was
utterly spent from climbing one high mountain after another,
but we felt no lasting bad effects from the venture. But we
had no food! Our cabins were roofed over with hides,
which now we had to take down and boil for food. They
saved life, but to eat them was like eating a pot of glue, and
I could not swallow them. The roof of our cabin having
been taken off, the Breens gave us a shelter, and when Mrs.
Breen discovered what I had tried to hide from my own
family, that I could not eat the hide, she gave me little bits
of meat now and then from their fast-dwindling store.</p>

<p>"One thing was my great comfort from that time," says
Virginia. "The Breens were the only Catholics in the party,
and prayers were said regularly every night and morning in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
their little cabin, Mr. Breen reading by the light of a small
pine torch, which I held, kneeling by his side. There was
something inexpressibly comforting to me in this simple
service, and one night when we had all gone to bed, huddled
together to keep from freezing, and I felt it would not be
long before we would all go to sleep never to wake again in
this world, all at once I found myself on my knees, looking
up through the darkness and making a vow that if God
would send us relief and let me see my father again, I would
become a Catholic. And my prayer was answered.</p>

<p>"On the evening of February 19th, we were in the cabin,
weak and starving, when we heard Mr. Breen's voice outside,
crying:</p>

<p>"'Relief, thank God! Relief!'</p>

<p>"In a moment, before our unbelieving eyes, stood seven men
sent by Captain Sutter from the fort, and they had brought
an ample supply of flour and jerked beef, to save us from the
death which had already overtaken so many of our party.
There was joy at Donner Lake that night, for the men said:
'Relief parties will come and go until you have all crossed
the mountains safely.' But," Virginia's diary says:
"mingled with one joy were bitter tears. Even strong men
sat and wept as they saw the dead lying about on the snow,
some even unburied, as the living had not had strength to
bury them. I sorrowed most for Milt Elliott&mdash;our faithful
friend, who seemed so like a brother, and when he died,
mother and I dragged him out of the cabin and covered him
with snow, and I patted the pure white snow down softly
over all but his face&mdash;and dragged myself away, with a heart
aching from the pain of such a loss.</p>

<p>"But we were obliged to turn our thoughts to the living and
their future, and eagerly listened to the story of the men, who
told us that when father arrived at Sutter's Fort, after meeting
Mr. Stanton, he told Captain Sutter of our desperate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
plight and the captain at once furnished horses and supplies,
with which father and Mr. McCutchen started back, but
were obliged to return to the fort, and while they were conferring
with Captain Sutter about their next move, the seven
living members of the 'Forlorn Hope' party who had left
us the first part of the winter, arrived at the fort. Their
pale, worn faces told the story and touched all hearts.
Cattle were killed and men were up all night drying beef and
making flour by hand-mills for us; then the party started
out to our rescue and they had not reached us one moment
too soon!</p>

<p>"Three days later, the first relief started from Donner
Lake with a party of twenty-three men, women, and children,
and our family was among them. It was a bright, sunny
day and we felt happy, but we had not gone far when Patty
and Tommy gave out. As gently as possible I told mother
that they would have to go back to the lake and wait for the
next expedition. Mother insisted that she would go back
with them, but the relief party would not allow this, and
finally she gave in and let the children go in care of a Mr.
Hover. Even the bravest of the men had tears in their
eyes when little Patty patted mother's cheek and said,
'I want to see papa, but I will take good care of Tommy,
and I do not want you to come back.' Meanwhile we
traveled on, heavy-hearted, struggling through the snow
single file. The men on snow-shoes broke the way and we
followed in their tracks. At night we lay down on the snow
to sleep, to awake to find our clothing all frozen. At break
of day we were on the road again.... The sunshine, which
it would seem would have been welcome, only added to our
misery. The dazzling reflection made it very trying to our
eyes, while its heat melted our frozen clothing and made it
cling to our bodies. Jim was too small to step in the tracks
made by the men, and to walk at all he had to place his knee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
on the little hill of snow after each step, and climb over it.
Mother and I coaxed him along by telling him that every
step he took he was getting nearer papa and nearer something
to eat. He was the youngest child that walked over the
Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>"On their way to our rescue the relief party from Sutter's
Fort had left meat hanging on a tree for our use as we came
out. What was their horror when we reached the spot to
find that it had been taken by wild animals. We were
starving again&mdash;where could we get food? As we were trying
to decide on our next move, one of the men who was in
the lead ahead stopped, turned, and called out:</p>

<p>"'Is Mrs. Reed with you? If she is, tell her Mr. Reed is
here!' There before us stood father! At the sight, mother,
weak with joy, fell on her knees with outstretched arms,
while I tried to run to meet him, but found myself too much
exhausted, so I just held out my arms, too, and waited!
In a moment he was where we could touch him and know
that he was flesh and blood and not just a beautiful dream.
He had planned to meet us just where we were, and had
brought with him fourteen men and a generous supply of
bread.</p>

<p>"As he knelt and clasped mother in his arms she told him
that Patty and Tommy were still at the lake, and with a
horrified exclamation, he started to his feet. 'I must go for
them at once,' he said. 'There is no time to lose.' With
one long embrace off he went as if on winged feet, traveling
the distance which had taken us five days to go in two, we
afterward heard. He found the children alive, to his great
joy, but, oh, what a sight met his gaze! The famished little
children and the death-like look of all at the lake made his
heart ache. He filled Patty's apron with biscuits, which she
carried around, giving one to each person. He also had soup
made for the infirm, and rendered every possible assistance to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the sufferers, then, leaving them with provisions for seven
days, he started off, taking with him seventeen who were
able to travel, and leaving at the lake three of his men to aid
those who were too weak to walk.</p>

<p>"Almost as soon as father's party started out, they were
caught in a terrible snow-storm and hurricane, and his
description of the scene later was heart-breaking, as he told
about the crying of the half-frozen children, the lamenting
of the mothers and suffering of the whole party, while above
all could be heard the shrieking of the storm king. One who
has never seen a blizzard in the Sierras can have no idea of
the situation, but we knew. All night father and his men
worked in the raging storm, trying to put up shelters for the
dying women and children, while at times the hurricane
would burst forth with such fury that he felt frightened on
account of the tall timber surrounding the camp. The
party was almost without food, having left so much with the
sufferers at the lake. Father had <i>cached</i> provisions on his
way to the lake, and had sent three men forward to get it
before the storm set in, but they could not get back. At one
time the fire was nearly gone; had it been lost, all would
have perished. For three days and three nights they were
exposed to the fury of that terrible storm; then father
became snow-blind, and would have died if two of his faithful
comrades had not worked over him all night, but from that
time all responsibility of the relief work was taken from him,
as he was physically unfit.</p>

<p>"At last the storm abated, and the party halted, while
father with Mr. McCutchen and Mr. Miller went on ahead
to send back aid for those who were exhausted from the
terrible journeying. Hiram Miller carried Tommy, while
Patty started bravely to walk, but soon she sank on the snow
and seemed to be dying. All gathered around in frantic
efforts to revive the child, and luckily father found some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
crumbs in the thumb of his woolen mitten which he warmed
and moistened between his own lips, and fed Patty. Slowly
she came to life again, and was carried along by different
ones in the company, so that by the time the party reached
Woodworth's Camp she was quite herself again, and as she
sat cozily before a big camp-fire she fondled and talked to a
tiny doll which had traveled with her all the way from
Springfield and which was her chosen confidante.</p>

<p>"As soon as father's party reached Woodworth's Camp a
third relief party started back to help those who were slowly
following, and still another party went on to Donner Lake
to the relief of those who were still living. But many of
that emigrant band lie sleeping to-day on the shore of that
quiet mountain lake, for out of the eighty-three persons who
were snowed in there, forty-two died, and of the thirty-one
emigrants who left Springfield on that lovely April morning
of 1846, only eighteen lived to reach California. Among
them were our family, who, despite the terrible hardships
and hideous privations we had suffered, yet seemed to have
been especially watched over by a kind Providence, for we all
lived to reach our goal, and were the only family who were
not obliged at some part of the journey to subsist on human
flesh to keep from perishing. God was good to our family,
and I, Virginia, testify to the heroic qualities which were
developed in even the youngest of us, and for my own part, I
gratefully recognize the blessings which came to me from an
unqualified faith in God and an unfaltering trust that He
would take care of us&mdash;which He did.</p>

<p>"Mother, Jimmy and I reached California and were taken
at once to the home of the mayor, Mr. Sinclair, where we
were given a warm welcome and where nothing was left
undone for our comfort. But we were still too anxious to be
happy, for we knew that father's party had been caught in
the storm." Virginia says: "I can see mother now as she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
stood leaning against the door for hours at a time, looking
at the mountains. At last&mdash;oh wonderful day&mdash;they came,
father, Patty and Tommy! In the moment of blissful
reunion tears and smiles intermingled and all the bitterness
and losses and sorrows of the cruel journey were washed
away, leaving only a tender memory of those noble souls
who had fared forth, not to the land of their dreams, but to a
far country whose maker and builder is God.</p>

<p>"And for us, it was spring in California!"</p>

<h2>LOUISA M. ALCOTT: AUTHOR OF
"LITTLE WOMEN"</h2>


<p>In a pleasant, shady garden in Concord, Massachusetts,
under a gnarled old apple-tree, sat a very studious looking
little person, bending over a sheet of paper on which she was
writing. She had made a seat out of a tree stump, and a
table by laying a board across two carpenter's horses, whose
owner was working in the house, and no scholar writing a
treatise on some deep subject could have been more absorbed
in his work than was the little girl in the garden.</p>

<p>For a whole long hour she wrote, frequently stopping to
look off into the distance and bite the end of her pencil with a
very learned look, then she would bend over her paper again
and write hard and fast. Finally, she laid down her pencil
with an air of triumph, jumped up from the stump and
rushed toward the house.</p>

<p>"Mother! Anna! I've written a poem about the robin
we found this morning in the garden!" Dashing into the
library she waved the paper in the air with a still more
excited cry: "Listen!" and dropped on the floor to read
her poem to a much thrilled audience of two. With great
dramatic effect she read her lines, glancing up from time to
time to see that she was producing the proper effect. This
is what she read:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">TO THE FIRST ROBIN<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Welcome, welcome, little stranger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear no harm and fear no danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are glad to see you here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you sing "Sweet Spring is near."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now the white snow melts away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the flowers blossom gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, dear bird, and build your nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we love our robin best.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She finished with an upward tilt of her voice, while her
mother excitedly flourished the stocking she was darning
over her head, crying: "Good! Splendid!" and quiet Anna
echoed the words, looking with awe at her small sister, as she
added, "It's just like Shakespeare!"</p>

<p>The proud mother did not say much more in praise of the
budding poetess's effort, for fear of making her conceited;
but that night, after the verses had been read to a delighted
father, and the young author had gone happily off to bed,
the mother said:</p>

<p>"I do believe she is going to be a genius, Bronson!"</p>

<p>Yet, despite the prediction, even an appreciative parent
would have been more than surprised had she been able to
look into the future and had seen her daughter as one of the
most famous writers of books for young people of her generation.
The little girl who sat under the apple-tree on that day
in early spring and wrote the verses was no other than Louisa
May Alcott, and her tribute to the robin was to be treasured
in after years as the first evidence of its writer's talent.</p>

<p>Louisa, the second daughter of Amos Bronson and Abba
May Alcott, was born in Germantown, Pa., on the 29th of
November, 1832, and was fortunate in being the child of
parents who not only understood the intense, restless and
emotional nature of this daughter, but were deeply interested
in developing it in such a way that her marked traits would
be valuable to her in later life. To this unfailing sympathy
of both father and mother the turbulent nature owed much
of its rich achievement, and Louisa Alcott's home surroundings
and influences had as much to do with her success
as a writer as had her talent, great as that was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
At the time of her birth her father was teaching school in
Germantown, but he was a man whose ideas were original
and far in advance of his time, and his way of teaching was
not liked by the parents of his pupils, so when Louisa was
two years old and her older sister, Anna, four, the family
went to Boston, where Mr. Alcott opened his famous school
in Masonic Temple, and enjoyed teaching by his own new
methods, and when he was happy his devoted wife was
equally contented.</p>

<p>Louisa was too young to go to school then, except as a
visitor, but her father developed her young mind at home
according to his own theories of education, and during the
remainder of the all-too short days the active child was free
to amuse herself as she chose. To play on the Common was
her great delight, for she was a born investigator, and there
she met children of all classes, who appealed to her many-sided
nature in different ways. Louisa was never a respecter
of class distinctions&mdash;it did not matter to her where people
lived, or whether their hands and faces were dirty, if some
personal characteristic attracted her to them, and from those
early days she was unconsciously studying human nature,
and making ready for the work of later years.</p>

<p>In her own sketch of those early days, she says:</p>

<p>"Running away was one of my great delights, and I still
enjoy sudden flights out of the nest to look about this very
interesting world and then go back to report!"</p>

<p>On one of her investigating tours, she met some Irish
children whose friendliness delighted her, and she spent a
wonderful day with them, sharing their dinner of cold potatoes,
salt fish and bread crusts. Then&mdash;delightful pastime&mdash;they
all played in the ash-heaps for some time, and took a
trip to the Common together. But when twilight came, her
new friends deserted her, leaving her a long way from home,
and little Louisa began to think very longingly of her mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and sister. But as she did not know how to find her way
back she sat down on a door-step, where a big dog was lying.
He was so friendly that she cuddled up against his broad
back and fell asleep. How long she slept she did not know,
but she was awakened by the loud ringing of a bell, and a
man's deep voice calling:</p>

<p>"Little girl lost! Six years old&mdash;in a pink frock, white hat
and new green shoes. Little girl lost! Little girl lost!"</p>

<p>It was the town crier, and as he rang his bell and gave his
loud cry, out of the darkness he heard a small voice exclaim:</p>

<p>"Why, dat's <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>With great difficulty the crier was able to persuade the
child to unclasp her arms from the neck of the big friendly
dog, but at last she left him, and was taken to the crier's
home and "feasted sumptuously on bread and molasses in a
tin plate with the alphabet round it," while her frantic
family was being notified. The unhappy ending to that
incident is very tersely told by Louisa, who says: "My fun
ended the next day, when I was tied to the arm of the sofa to
repent at leisure!"</p>

<p>That the six years spent in Boston were happy ones, and
that the budding spirit of Louisa was filled with joy at merely
being alive, was shown one morning, when, at the breakfast
table, she suddenly looked up with an all-embrasive smile
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I love everybody in <i>dis</i> whole world!"</p>

<p>Despite the merriment which was always a feature of the
Alcott home, as they were all blessed with a sense of humor
which helped them over many a hard place, there was an
underlying anxiety for Mr. and Mrs. Alcott, as the school
was gradually growing smaller and there was barely enough
income to support their family, to which a third daughter,
Elizabeth, the "Beth" of <i>Little Women</i>, had been added
recently. During those days they lived on very simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
fare, which the children disliked, as their rice had to be eaten
without sugar and their mush without butter or molasses.
Nor did Mr. Alcott allow meat on his table, as he thought it
wrong to eat any creature which had to be killed for the
purpose. An old family friend who lived at a Boston hotel
sympathized strongly with the children's longing for sweets,
and every day at dinner she saved them a piece of pie or cake,
which Louisa would call for, carrying a bandbox for the
purpose. The friend was in Europe for years, and when she
returned Louisa Alcott had become famous. Meeting her
on the street one day, Louisa greeted her old friend, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Why, I did not think you would remember me!" said the
old lady.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I shall ever forget that bandbox!" was
the quick reply.</p>

<p>As time went on, Mr. Alcott's school dwindled until he
had only five scholars, and three of them were his own children.
Something new had to be tried, and quickly, so the
family moved out of the city, into a small house at Concord,
Mass., which had an orchard and a garden, and, best of all,
the children had a big barn, where they gave all sorts of entertainments;
mostly plays, as they were born actors. Their
mother, or "Marmee," as the girls called her, loved the fun
as well as they did, and would lay aside her work at any
moment to make impossible costumes for fairies, gnomes,
kings or peasants, who were to take the principal parts in
some stirring melodrama written by the girls themselves, or
some adaptation of an old fairy tale. They acted Jack the
Giant-killer in fine style, and the giant came tumbling
headlong from a loft when Jack cut down the squash-vine
running up a ladder and supposed to represent the immortal
beanstalk. At other performances Cinderella rolled away in
an impressive pumpkin, and one of their star plays was a
dramatic version of the story of the woman who wasted her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
three wishes, in which a long black pudding was lowered by
invisible hands and slowly fastened onto her nose.</p>

<p>But though the big barn often echoed with the sound of
merry voices, at other times the girls dressed up as pilgrims,
and journeyed over the hill with scrip and staff, and cockle
shells in their hats; fairies held their revels among the whispering
birches, and strawberry parties took place in the rustic
arbor of the garden.</p>

<p>And there we find eight-year-old Louisa writing her verses
to the robin, with genius early beginning to burn in the
small head which later proved to be so full of wonderful
material for the delight of young people.</p>

<p>"Those Concord days were the happiest of my life," says
Miss Alcott. "We had charming playmates in the little
Emersons, Channings, Goodwins and Hawthornes, with the
illustrious parents and their friends to enjoy our pranks and
share our excursions.... My wise mother, anxious to give
me a strong body to support a lively brain, turned me loose
in the country and let me run wild, learning of Nature what
no books can teach, and being led&mdash;as those who truly love
her seldom fail to be&mdash;'through Nature up to Nature's
God.'"</p>

<p>The Alcott children were encouraged to keep diaries in
which they wrote down their thoughts and feelings and
fancies, and even at that early age Louisa's journal was a
record of deep feelings and of a child's sacred emotions. In
one of her solemn moods, she makes this entry:</p>

<p>"I had an early run in the woods before the dew was off
the grass. The moss was like velvet, and as I ran under
the arch of yellow and red leaves I sang for joy, my heart
was so bright and the world so beautiful. I stopped at the
end of the walk and saw the sunshine out over the wide
'Virginia meadows.'</p>

<p>"It seemed like going through a dark life or grave into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
heaven beyond. A very strange and solemn feeling came
over me as I stood there, with no sound but the rustle of the
pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me
alone. It seemed as if I <i>felt</i> God as I never did before, and I
prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of
nearness all my life."</p>

<p>To that entry there is a note added, years later: "<i>I have</i>,
for I most sincerely think that the little girl 'got religion'
that day in the wood, when dear Mother Nature led her to
God."&mdash;L. M. A. 1885.</p>

<p>That deep religious note in Louisa Alcott's nature is very
marked and is evident in all of her work, but, on the other
hand, she had a sparkling wit and such a keen sense of
humor that in her blackest moods she could always see
something funny to amuse her, and frequently laughed at
her own expense.</p>

<p>That her conscience was as active as her mind and her
body is shown by one of her "private plays," which she
makes Demi describe in <i>Little Men</i>. He says:</p>

<p>"I play that my mind is a round room, and my soul is a
little sort of creature with wings that lives in it. The walls
are full of shelves and drawers, and in them I keep my
thoughts, and my goodness and badness and all sorts of
things. The goods I keep where I can see them, and the
bads I lock up tight, but they get out, and I have to keep
putting them in and squeezing them down, they are so
strong. The thoughts I play with when I am alone or in bed,
and I make up and do what I like with them. Every Sunday
I put my room in order, and talk with the little spirit that
lives there, and tell him what to do. He is very bad sometimes
and won't mind me, and I have to scold him."</p>

<p>Truly a strange game for a child to play, but the Alcotts
were brought up to a reverent knowledge of their souls as
well as their bodies, and many a sober talk at twilight did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
mother or father have with the daughters to whom the
experience of the older generation was helpful and inspiring.
A very happy family they were, despite frequent lack of
luxuries and even necessities, but loyalty and generosity as
their marked characteristics. No matter how little money
or food an Alcott had, it was always shared with any one who
had less, and the largest share was usually given away.</p>

<p>On Louisa's fourth birthday, she tells of a feast given in
her honor in her father's school-room in Masonic Temple.
All the children were there, and Louisa wore a crown of flowers
and stood upon a table to give a cake to each child as they
all marched around the table. "By some oversight," says
Louisa, "the cakes fell short, and I saw that if I gave away
the last one, <i>I</i> should have none. As I was queen of the
revel, I felt that I ought to have it, and held on to it tightly,
until my mother said: 'It is always better to give away than
to keep the nice things; so I know my Louy will not let the
little friend go without.'" She adds: "The little friend
received the dear plummy cake, and I ... my first lesson
in the sweetness of self-denial&mdash;a lesson which my dear
mother illustrated all her long and noble life."</p>

<p>At another time a starving family was discovered, when
the Alcotts, forming in a procession, carried their own breakfast
to the hungry ones. On one occasion, when a friend
had unexpected guests arrive for dinner, too late to secure any
extra provisions, the Alcotts with great glee lent their dinner
to the thankful hostess, and thought it a good joke. Again,
on a snowy Saturday night, when their wood-pile was extra
low, and there was no way of getting any more that week, a
poor child came to beg a little, as their baby was sick and
the father on a spree with all his wages. At first Mrs.
Alcott hesitated, as it was bitterly cold and Abba May, the
little baby sister, was very young, but Mr. Alcott decided
the matter with his usual kindly optimism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
"Give half our stock and trust in Providence; the weather
will moderate or wood will come," he declared. And the
wood was lent, Mrs. Alcott cheerily agreeing: "Well, their
need is greater than ours. If our half gives out we can go to
bed and tell stories!"</p>

<p>A little later in the evening, while it was still snowing
heavily, and the Alcotts were about to cover their fire to
keep it, a farmer who was in the habit of supplying them
with wood knocked at the door and asked anxiously:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like me to drop my load of wood here?
It would accommodate me, and you need not hurry to pay
for it. I started for Boston with it but the snow is drifting
so fast, I want to go home."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Alcott, and as the man went away,
he turned to his wife and exclaimed: "Didn't I tell you that
wood would come if the weather didn't moderate?"</p>

<p>Again, a tramp asked Mr. Alcott to lend him five dollars.
As he had only a ten-dollar bill, the dear man at once offered
that, asking to have the change brought back as soon as
possible. Despite the disbelief of his family in the tramp's
honesty, the man did bring the five-dollar bill soon with
profuse thanks, and the gentle philosopher's faith in human
nature was not crushed.</p>

<p>Still another experiment in generosity proved a harder
one in its results to the Alcotts, when Mrs. Alcott allowed
some poor emigrants to rest in her garden while she treated
them to a bountiful meal. Unfortunately for their generous
benefactor, in return they gave small-pox to the entire
family, and, although the girls had light cases, Mr. and Mrs.
Alcott were very sick and, as Miss Alcott records later:
"We had a curious time of exile, danger and trouble." She
adds: "No doctors and all got well."</p>

<p>When Louisa Alcott was almost ten years old, and Anna
twelve, Mr. Alcott took a trip to England, hoping to interest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the people there in his new theories of education and of
living. So enthusiastically and beautifully did he present
his theories that he won many converts, and one of them, a
Mr. Lane, returned to America with him to help him found a
colony on the new ideas, which were more ideal than practical,
and so disapproved of by Mr. Alcott's friends, who
thought him foolish to waste time and money on them.</p>

<p>However, after months of planning, Mr. Alcott, Mr.
Lane and other enthusiasts decided to buy an estate of one
hundred acres near Harvard Village, Mass., and establish
the colony. The place was named "Fruitlands," in anticipation
of future crops, and the men who were to start the community
were full of hope and enthusiasm, in which Mrs.
Alcott did not share, as she knew her husband's visionary
nature too well not to fear the result of such an experiment.
However, she aided in making the plan as practical as she
could, and drew such a rosy picture of their new home to the
children that they expected life at Fruitlands to be a perpetual
picnic.</p>

<p>Alas for visions and for hopes! Although life at Fruitlands
had its moments of sunshine and happiness, yet they
were far overbalanced by hard work, small results and increasing
worry over money matters, and at last, after four
years of struggle to make ends meet, Mr. Alcott was obliged
to face the fact that the experiment had been an utter failure,
that he had exhausted his resources of mind, body and
estate. It was a black time for the gentle dreamer, and for a
while it seemed as if despair would overwhelm him. But
with his brave wife to help him and the children's welfare
to think of, he shook off his despondency bravely, and decided
to make a fresh start. So Mrs. Alcott wrote to her
brother in Boston for help, sold all the furniture they could
spare, and went to Still River, the nearest village to Fruitlands,
and engaged four rooms. "Then on a bleak December
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
day the Alcott family emerged from the snowbank in which
Fruitlands, now re-christened <i>Apple Stump</i> by Mrs. Alcott,
lay hidden. Their worldly goods were piled on an ox-sled,
the four girls on the top, while father and mother trudged
arm in arm behind, poorer indeed in worldly goods, but
richer in love and faith and patience, and alas, experience."</p>

<p>After a winter in Still River they went back to Concord,
where they occupied a few rooms in the house of a sympathetic
friend&mdash;not all their friends were sympathetic, by any
means, as most of them had warned Mr. Alcott of this ending
to his experiment. But all were kindly as they saw the
family take up life bravely in Concord again, with even fewer
necessities and comforts than before. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Alcott did whatever work they could find to do, thinking
nothing too menial if it provided food and clothing for their
family. Naturally the education of the children was
rather fragmentary and insufficient, but it developed their
own powers of thinking. Through the pages of their diaries
in which they wrote regularly, and which were open to their
mother and father, they learned to express their thoughts
clearly on all subjects. Also they were encouraged to read
freely, while only the best books were within their reach.
Louisa's poetic and dramatic efforts were not ridiculed, but
criticized as carefully as if they had been masterpieces, so
she had no fear of expressing her deepest thoughts, but acted
out her own nature freely and fearlessly.</p>

<p>In fact the four daughters were happy, wholesome, hearty
girls, whose frolics and pastimes took such unique forms that
people wondered whether they were the result of Mr. Alcott's
theories, and Miss Alcott tells of one afternoon when
Mr. Emerson and Margaret Fuller were visiting her mother
and the conversation drifted to the subject of education.
Turning to Mr. Alcott, Miss Fuller said:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Alcott, you have been able to carry out your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
methods in your own family; I should like to see your model
children."</p>

<p>A few moments later, as the guests stood on the door-step,
ready to leave, there was a wild uproar heard in the
near distance and round the corner of the house came a
wheel-barrow holding baby May, dressed as a queen; Miss
Alcott says: "I was the horse, bitted and bridled, and
driven by my sister Anna, while Lizzie played dog and
barked as loud as her gentle voice permitted.</p>

<p>"All were shouting and wild with fun, which, however,
came to a sudden end, for my foot tripped and
down we all went in a laughing heap, while my mother
put a climax to the joke by saying with a dramatic wave
of the hand:</p>

<p>"'Here are the model children, Miss Fuller!'"</p>

<p>When Mrs. Alcott's father, Colonel May, died, he left his
daughter a small property, and she now determined to buy a
house in Concord with it, so that whatever the varying
fortunes of the family might be in future they would at least
have a roof over their heads. An additional amount of five
hundred dollars was added by Mr. Emerson, who was always
the good angel of the family, and the place in Concord
known as "Hillside" was bought, where life and work began
in earnest for Louisa and her sisters, for only too clearly
they saw the heavy weight that was being laid on their
mother's shoulders.</p>

<p>Louisa was growing in body and spirit in those days,
stretching up physically and mentally, and among the sources
of her finest inspiration was the gentle reformer, philosopher
and writer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was ever her father's
loyal friend and helper. Louisa's warm little heart enshrined
the calm, great-minded man who always understood things,
and after she had read Goethe's correspondence with Bettine,
she, like Bettine, placed her idol on a pedestal and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
worshipped him in a truly romantic fashion. At night, after
she had gone to her room, she wrote him long passionate
letters, expressing her devotion, but she never sent the letters&mdash;only
told him of them in later years, when they laughed
together over her girlish fancy. Once, she confessed to
having sat in a tall cherry-tree at midnight and sung to the
moon until the owls scared her to bed; and of having sung
Mignon's song under his window in very bad German, and
strewed wild flowers over his door-step in the darkness.
This sounds very sentimental and silly, but Louisa was never
that. She had a deep, intense nature, which as yet had
found no outlet or expression, and she could have had no
safer hero to worship than this gentle, serene, wise man whose
friendship for her family was so practical in its expression.
Also at that period, which Louisa herself in her diary calls
the "sentimental period," she was strongly influenced by
the poet and naturalist, Thoreau. From him she learned to
know Nature in a closer and more loving intimacy. Thoreau
was called a hermit, and known as a genius, and more often
than not he could be found in his hut in the woods, or on
the river bank, where he learned to look for the bright-eyed
"Alcott girl," who would swing along his side in twenty-mile
tramps, eager and inquisitive about everything, learning
new facts about flowers and trees and birds and insects from
the great man at her side. Truly a fortunate girl was
Louisa, with two such friends and teachers as the great
Emerson and Thoreau. Hawthorne, too, fascinated her in
his shy reserve, and the young girl in her teens with a tremendous
ability to do and to be something worth while in
life could have had no more valuable preface to her life as a
writer than that of the happy growing days at Concord,
with that group of remarkable men.</p>

<p>At that time she did not think seriously of having talent
for writing, as she had only written a half-dozen pieces of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
verse, among them one called "My Kingdom," which has
been preserved as a bit of girlish yearning for the best in
religion and in character, sweetly expressed, and some
thrilling melodramas for the "troupe" in the barn to act.
These were overflowing with villains and heroes, and were
lurid enough to satisfy the most intense of her audience.
Later some of them were collected under the title of "Comic
Tragedies"&mdash;but at best they only serve to show how full of
imaginative possibilities the girl's nature was.</p>

<p>Although the Alcotts had their own home in Concord now,
it was yet almost impossible to make ends meet, and with the
sturdy independence which proved to be one of her marked
traits, Louisa determined to earn some money and add to
the family income. It was no easy thing to do, for there
were few avenues of work open to girls in that day. But
she could teach, for it was quite a popular resource to open a
small school in some barn, with a select set of pupils. Louisa
herself had been to one of these "barn schools," and now she
opened one in Mr. Emerson's barn, but it paid very poorly, as
did everything which the Alcotts attempted to do. The
brave mother was so completely discouraged, that when one
day a friend passing through Concord called on her, Mrs.
Alcott confessed the state of her financial affairs. As a
result of that confession, the family once more migrated to
Boston, leaving the Hawthornes as occupants of "Hillside."
In the city Mrs. Alcott was given a position as visitor to the
poor by a benevolent association, and she also kept an
employment agency&mdash;a more respectable occupation than
it was in later years. Once more there was money in the
treasury, and with their usual happy optimism the family
cheered up and decided that life was worth living, even under
the most trying circumstances. While his wife was busy
in that way, Mr. Alcott gradually drew a circle of people
around him to whom his theories of life were acceptable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
who paid a small price to attend the "conversations" he
held on subjects which interested him to discuss. Being
appreciated, even by a small audience, was balm to the
wounded spirit of the gentle philosopher, whose "Fruitlands"
experiment had been such a bitter one, and now he was as
happy as though he were earning large amounts by his
work, instead of the meager sum paid by his disciples to hear
him talk of his pet theories. But he was contented, and his
happiness was reflected by his adoring family. Mrs. Alcott,
too, was satisfied with the work she was doing, so for a time
all went well with the "Pathetic Family" as Louisa had
christened them.</p>

<p>Louisa, meanwhile, was learning many lessons as she
traveled slowly up the road to womanhood&mdash;learning courage
and self-denial, linked with cheerfulness from mother
and father, and enjoying a wholesome comradeship in the
home life with her sisters.</p>

<p>Anna, the oldest daughter, was much like her father. She
never worried about her soul or her shortcomings as Louisa
did; she accepted life as it came, without question, and was
of a calm nature, unlike turbulent, questioning Louisa, who
had as many moods as there were hours in a day and who
found ruling her tempestuous nature the hardest piece of
work life offered her. She confesses in her diary: "My
quick tongue is always getting me into trouble, and my
moodiness makes it hard to be cheerful when I think how
poor we are, how much worry it is to live, and how many
things I long to do&mdash;I never can. So every day is a battle,
and I'm so tired I don't want to live, only it's cowardly to
die till you have done something." Having made this confession
to an unresponsive page of her journal, the restless
nature gave up the desire to be a coward, and turned to
achieving whatever work might come to her hand to do,
little dreaming what was before her in the coming years.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
She was very fine looking, of which she evidently was conscious,
for she says in her diary:</p>

<p>"If I look in my glass I try to keep down vanity about my
long hair, my well-shaped head, and my good nose." Besides
these good points of which she speaks so frankly, she
was tall and graceful, with a heavy mass of glossy, chestnut-brown
hair. Her complexion was clear and full of color, and
her dark-blue eyes were deep-set and very expressive.</p>

<p>During those years in Boston, the Alcotts spent two summers
in an uncle's roomy house, where they enjoyed such
comforts as had not before fallen to their lot, and calm
Anna, sweet retiring Beth, or Betty, as she was called, and
artistic May, the youngest of the flock, revelled in having
rooms of their own, and plenty of space for their own belongings.
May was a pretty, golden-haired, blue-eyed
child with decided tastes, and an ability to get what she
most wanted in life without much effort&mdash;an ability which
poor Louisa entirely lacked, for her success always came as
the result of exhausting work.</p>

<p>Louisa was now seventeen years old, and Anna nineteen.
At that time came the small-pox siege, and after Anna had
recovered partially she was obliged to take a rest, leaving
her small school in Louisa's charge. There were twenty
scholars, and it was a great responsibility for the girl of
seventeen, but she took up the work with such enthusiasm
that she managed to captivate her pupils, whose attention
she held by illustrating many of their lessons with original
stories, telling them in a way they would never forget.
When Anna came back the school was so flourishing that
Louisa continued to help with the teaching, and it seemed
probable that she had found her greatest talent, although
little did she guess how many interesting avenues of experience
were to widen before her wondering eyes before she
was to settle down to her life-work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Meanwhile she kept on helping Anna with her school, and
to liven up the daily routine of a rather dull existence she
began to write thrilling plays, which she always read to
Anna, who criticized and helped revise them with sisterly severity.
The plays were acted by a group of the girls' friends,
with Anna and Louisa usually taking the principal parts.
From creating these wonderful melodramas, which always
won loud applause from an enthusiastic audience, and because
of her real ability to act, Louisa now decided that she
would go on the real stage. "Anna wants to be an actress,
and so do I," she wrote in her diary. "We could make
plenty of money perhaps, and it is a very gay life. Mother
says we are too young, and must wait."</p>

<p>Wise mother, and firm as wise! The girls were obliged
to accept her decree, and Louisa was so depressed by it that for
a time she made every one miserable by her downcast mood.
Then, fortunately, an interested relative showed one of her
plays to the manager of the Boston Theater. He read
"The Rival Prima Donnas" with kindly eyes, and offered to
stage it. Here was good luck indeed! The entire Alcott
family held as great a jubilation when they heard the news as
if they had fallen heir to a fortune, and Louisa at once forgot
her ambition to act, in her ambition to be known as a successful
play-wright.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was some hitch in the arrangements,
and the play was never produced, but the manager sent
Louisa a free pass to the theater, which gave her a play-wright's
pride whenever she used it, and her enjoyment in
anticipating the production had been so great that she was
able to bear the actual disappointment with real philosophy.
And by that time her mood had changed. Although she always
loved to act, and acted well, her own good sense had asserted
itself, and she had set aside a dramatic career, realizing
that it included too many difficulties and hardships.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Her next adventure was quite different. To her mother's
employment office came a gentleman who wished a companion
for his old father and sister. The position offered
only light work, and seemed a good one in every respect, and
impulsive Louisa, who happened to hear the request, asked
her mother, eagerly: "Can't I go? Oh, do let <i>me</i> take it!"
Her mother, thinking the experience would not be harmful,
let her accept the position, and as a result she had two of the
most disillusioning and hard months of her life. She had
her revenge later by writing a story called "How I Went Out
to Service," in which she described the experience in a vivid
way.</p>

<p>An extract from her "heart journal," as she now called
her diary, is a revelation of home life which gave to Louisa
much of that understanding of human nature which has
made her books so popular. She says: "Our poor little
home had much love and happiness in it, and was a shelter
for lost girls, abused wives, friendless children and weak
or wicked men. Father and mother had no money to give,
but gave their time, sympathy, help, and if blessings would
make them rich they would be millionaires. This is practical
Christianity."</p>

<p>At that time they were living in a small house, with Beth
as housekeeper, while Anna and Louisa taught, May went to
school, and the mother attended to her own work. Mr.
Alcott, too, was doing all he could to add to the family income
by his lectures, and by writing articles on his favorite
subjects, so all together, they managed to live in some sort of
fashion. But Louisa had now made up her mind that she
must do more for the comfort of the beloved mother, who
was always over-worked and worried, despite her courage
and cheery manner, and she decided to try to publish a story.</p>

<p>Full of the intention, one night, she sat down on the floor
and searched through the pile of papers which included most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of her "scribblings" since her first use of a pen. Plays,
poems and many other closely written sheets were thrown
aside. At last she found what she was looking for, and read
and re-read it three times, then set it aside until morning,
when, with the greatest possible secrecy, she put it in an
envelope, sealed, addressed and mailed it. From that time
she went about her work with the air of one whose mind is
on greater things, but she was always wide awake enough
when it came time for some one to go for the mail,
and her sisters joked her about her eagerness for letters,
which she bore good-naturedly enough. Then came a
wonderful day when she was handed a letter from a well-known
firm of publishers. Her hand shook as she opened
it, and she gave a suppressed cry of joy as she read the
short note, and looked with amazement at the bit of paper
enclosed.</p>

<p>Later in the day, when the housework was done and school
was over, she sauntered into the room where the family was
gathered in a sewing-bee. Throwing herself into a chair
with an indifferent air, she asked:</p>

<p>"Want to hear a good story?"</p>

<p>Of course they did. The Alcotts were always ready for a
story, and Louisa read extremely well. Her audience listened
to the thrilling tale with eager attention, and at the
end there was a chorus of cries: "How fine! How lovely!
How interesting!" Then Anna asked: "Who wrote it?"
With shining eyes and crimson cheeks Louisa jumped to
her feet and, waving the paper overhead, cried:</p>

<p>"<i>Your sister! I wrote it!</i> Yes, I really did!"</p>

<p>One can imagine the great excitement of the group who
then clustered around the authoress and asked questions
all at once.</p>

<p>That first published story was pronounced by its creator
to be "great rubbish," and she only received the sum of five
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
dollars for it, but it was a beginning, and from that time in
her active brain plots for stories long and short began to
simmer, although she still taught, and often did sewing in
the evenings, for which she was fairly well paid.</p>

<p>In mid-winter of 1853 Mr. Alcott went West on a lecture
tour, full of hope for a financial success. He left the home
group as busy as usual, for Mrs. Alcott had several boarders,
as well as her employment office. Anna had gone to Syracuse
to teach in a school there, Louisa had opened a home school
with ten pupils, and the calm philosopher felt that he could
leave them with a quiet mind, as they were all earning
money, and this was his opportunity to broaden the field in
which the seeds of unique ideas were sown.</p>

<p>So off he went, full of eager courage, followed by the good
wishes of the girls, who fondly hoped that "father would be
appreciated at last." Alas for hopes! On a February
night, when all the household were sleeping soundly, the bell
rang violently. All were awakened, and Louisa says,
"Mother flew down, crying 'my husband!' We rushed
after, and five white figures embraced the half-frozen wanderer
who came in tired, hungry, cold and disappointed, but
smiling bravely, and as serene as ever. We fed and warmed
and brooded over him," says Louisa, "longing to ask if he had
made any money, but none did till little May said, after he
had told all the pleasant things: 'Well, did people pay
you?' Then, with a queer look, he opened his pocket-book
and showed one dollar, saying with a smile that made
our eyes fill: 'Only that! My overcoat was stolen, and I
had to buy a shawl. Many promises were not kept, and
traveling is costly, but I have opened the way, and another
year shall do better.'</p>

<p>"I shall never forget," adds Louisa, "how beautifully
mother answered him, though the dear hopeful soul had built
much on his success; but with a beaming face she kissed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
him, saying, 'I call that doing <i>very</i> well. Since you are
safely home, dear, we don't ask anything more.'</p>

<p>"Anna and I choked down our tears, and took a lesson
in real love which we never forgot.... It was half tragic
and comic, for father was very dirty and sleepy, and mother
in a big night-cap and funny old jacket."</p>

<p>Surely no one ever had a better opportunity to probe to
the heart of the real emotions that make up the most prosaic
as well as the most heroic daily lives than a member of that
generous, happy, loving Alcott family.</p>

<p>And still Louisa kept on doing other things besides the
writing, which was such a safety valve for her intense nature.
For a short time she worked for a relative in the country,
and she also taught and sewed and did housework, and
made herself useful wherever her strong hands and willing
heart could find some way of earning a dollar.</p>

<p>The seven years spent in Boston had developed her into a
capable young woman of twenty-two, who was ready and
eager to play her part in the great drama of life of which
she was an interested spectator as she saw it constantly
enacted around her.</p>

<p>Even then, before she had stepped across the threshold of
her career, she unconsciously realized that the home stage
is the real background of the supreme world drama, and she
shows this by the intimate, tender domestic scenes which
made all of her stories bits of real life, with a strong appeal
to those whose homes are joyous parts of the present, or
sacred memories.</p>

<p>When she was determined to achieve an end, Louisa
Alcott generally succeeded, even in the face of obstacles;
and now having decided to take on her own broad shoulders
some of the burdens which were weighing heavily on her
beloved mother, she turned to the talent which had recently
yielded her the magnificent sum of five dollars. In the days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
at Concord she had told many stories about fairies and
flowers to the little Emerson children and their friends, who
eagerly drank in all the mystic tales in which wood-nymphs,
water sprites, giants and fairy queens played a prominent
part, and the stories were thrilling, because their teller believed
absolutely in the fairy creatures she pictured in a
lovely setting of woodland glades and forest dells. These
stones, which she had written down and called "Flower
Fables," she found among her papers, and as she read them
again she felt that they might interest other children as
they had those to whom they were told. She had no money
to publish them, however, and no publisher would bear the
expense of a venture by an untried writer. But it took
more than that to daunt Louisa when her mind was made up.
With great enthusiasm she told a friend of the family,
Miss Wealthy Stevens, of her desire, and she generously
offered to pay for publication, but it was decided not to tell
the family until the book should come out. Then in radiant
secrecy Louisa burned the midnight oil and prepared the
little book for the press. One can fancy the proud surprise
of Mrs. Alcott when, on the following Christmas morning,
among her pile of gifts she found the little volume with
this note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="text-align: right">
December 25, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother:</span></p>

<p>Into your Christmas stocking I have put my first-born, knowing that
you will accept it with all its faults (for grandmothers are always kind)
and look upon it merely as an earnest of what I may yet do; for with so
much to cheer me on, I hope to pass in time from fairies and fables to men
and realities. Whatever beauty or poetry is to be found in my little book
is owing to your interest in, and encouragement of, my efforts from the
first to the last, and if ever I do anything to be proud of, my greatest happiness
will be that I can thank you for that, as I may do for all the good
there is in me, and I shall be content to write if it gives you pleasure.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jo is fussing about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lamp is going out.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
To dear mother, with many kind wishes for a Happy New Year and
Merry Christmas,</p>

<p class="center">I am ever your loving daughter,</p>

<p class="sig">Louy.</p>
</div>

<p>Recompense enough, that note, for all a loving mother's
sacrifices and attempts to give her daughter understanding
sympathy and love&mdash;and it is small wonder if that Christmas
gift always remained one of her most precious possessions.</p>

<p>Six hundred copies of the little "Flower Fables" were
published, and the book sold very well, although their
author only received the sum of $32 for them, which was
in sharp contrast, she says in her journal, "to the receipts
of six months only in 1886, being <i>eight thousand dollars</i> for
the sale of books and no new one; but" she adds, "I was
prouder over the thirty-two dollars than the eight thousand."</p>

<p>Louisa Alcott was now headed toward her destiny, although
she was still a long way from the shining goal of
literary success, and had many weary hills yet to climb.</p>

<p>As soon as <i>Flower Fables</i> was published, she began to plan
for a new volume of fairy tales, and as she was invited to
spend the next summer in the lovely New Hampshire village
of Walpole, she thankfully accepted the invitation, and
decided to write the new book there in the bracing air of the
hill town. In Walpole, she met delightful people, who were
all attracted to the versatile, amusing young woman, and
she was in great demand when there was any entertainment
on foot. One evening she gave a burlesque lecture on
"Woman, and Her Position, by Oronthy Bluggage," which
created such a gale of merriment that she was asked to repeat
it for money, which she did; and so there was added to her
store of accomplishments another, from which she was to
reap some rewards in coming years.</p>

<p>Her enjoyment of Walpole was so great that her family
decided to try its fine air, as they were tired of city life and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
needed a change of scene. A friend offered them a house
there, rent free, and in their usual impromptu way they left
Boston and arrived in the country village, bag and baggage.
Mr. Alcott was overjoyed to have a garden in which to
work, and Mrs. Alcott was glad to be near her niece, whose
guest Louisa had been up to that time.</p>

<p>Louisa's comment on their arrival in her diary was:</p>

<p>"Busy and happy times as we settle in the little house in
the lane, near by my dear ravine&mdash;plays, picnics, pleasant
people and good neighbors." Despite the good times, it is
evident that she was not idle, for she says, "Finished fairy
book in September.... Better than <i>Flower Fables</i>. Now,
I must try to sell it."</p>

<p>In September Anna had an offer to become a teacher in the
great idiot asylum in Syracuse. Her sensitive nature
shrank from the work, but with real self-sacrifice she accepted
it for the sake of the family, and went off in October.
Meanwhile Louisa had been thinking deeply about her
future, and her diary tells the story of a decision she made,
quite the most important one of her life. She writes:</p>

<p>"November; decided to seek my fortune, so with my
little trunk of home-made clothes, $40 earned by stories sent
to the <i>Gazette</i>, and my MSS., I set forth with mother's blessing
one rainy day in the dullest month in the year."</p>

<p>She went straight to Boston, where she writes:</p>

<p>"Found it too late to do anything with the book (the new
one she had written at Walpole) so put it away and tried for
teaching, sewing, or any honest work. Won't go home to sit
idle while I have a head and a pair of hands."</p>

<p>Good for you, Louisa&mdash;you are the stuff that success is
made of! That her courage had its reward is shown by the fact
that her cousins, the Sewalls, generously offered her a home
for the winter with them which she gratefully accepted, but
insisted on paying for her board by doing a great deal of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
sewing for them. She says in her diary: "I sew for Mollie
and others and write stories. C. gave me books to notice.
Heard Thackeray. Anxious times; Anna very home-sick.
Walpole very cold and dull, now the summer butterflies have
gone. Got $5 for a tale and $12 for sewing; sent home a
Christmas box to cheer the dear souls in the snow-banks."</p>

<p>In January she writes: "C. paid $6 for <i>A Sister's Trial</i>,
gave me more books to notice, and wants more tales."
The entries that follow give a vivid picture of her pluck
and perseverance in that first winter of fortune-seeking,
and no record of deeds could be more graphic than the following
entries:</p>

<p>"Sewed for L. W. Sewall and others. Mr. Field took my
farce to Mobile to bring out; Mr. Barry of the Boston
Theater has the play. Heard Curtis lecture. Began a
book for summer, <i>Beach Bubbles</i>. Mr. F. of the <i>Courier</i>
printed a poem of mine on 'Little Nell'. Got $10 for
'Bertha' and saw great yellow placards stuck up announcing
it. Acted at the W's. March; got $10 for 'Genevieve'.
Prices go up as people like the tales and ask who wrote
them.... Sewed a great deal, and got very tired; one job
for Mr. G. of a dozen pillow-cases, one dozen sheets, six fine
cambric neck-ties, and two dozen handkerchiefs, at which I
had to work all one night to get them done, ... I got only
$4.00." The brave, young fortune-seeker adds sensibly,
"Sewing won't make my fortune, but I can plan my stories
while I work."</p>

<p>In May she had a welcome visit from Anna on her way
home from Syracuse, as the work there was too hard for her,
and the sisters spent some happy days together in Boston.
Then they were obliged to go home, as dear little Beth was
very sick with scarlet-fever which she caught from some
poor children Mrs. Alcott had been nursing. Both Beth
and May had the dangerous disease, and Beth never recovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
from the effects of it, although she lived for two years, a
serene, patient invalid, who shed a benediction on the sorrowing
household. That summer was an anxious time for
the family. In her usual way Louisa plunged headlong
into housework and nursing, and when night came she would
scribble one of the stories which the papers were now glad
to accept whenever she could send them. So with varying
degrees of apprehension and rejoicing, the weary months
passed, and as Beth was slowly improving and she was not
needed at home, Louisa decided to spend another winter in
the city. Her diary says:</p>

<p>"There I can support myself and help the family. C.
offers $10 a month and perhaps more.... Others have
plenty of sewing; the play may come out, and Mrs. R.
will give me a sky-parlor for $3 a week, with fire and
board. I sew for her also." With practical forethought,
she adds, "If I can get A. L. to governess I shall be all
right."</p>

<p>Then in a burst of the real spirit which had animated her
ever since she first began to write and sew and teach and
act, and make over old clothes given her by rich friends
that she need not spend any money on herself, she declares
in her diary:</p>

<p>"I was born with a boy's spirit under my bib and tucker.
I <i>can't wait</i> when I <i>can work</i>; so I took my little talent in my
hand and forced the world again, braver than before, and
wiser for my failures."</p>

<p>That the decision was no light one, and that the winter in
Boston was not merely an adventure, is shown by her declaration:</p>

<p>"I don't often pray in words; but when I set out that day
with all my worldly goods in the little old trunk, my own
earnings ($25) in my pocket, and much hope and resolution
in my soul, my heart was very full, and I said to the Lord,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
'Help us all, and keep us for one another,' as I never said it
before, while I looked back at the dear faces watching me,
so full of love, and hope, and faith."</p>

<p>Louisa Alcott's childhood and girlhood, with all the
hardships and joys which went into the passing years, had
been merged in a triumphant young womanhood&mdash;a fitting
preface to the years of fame and fortune which were to
follow. A brave, interesting girl had become a courageous
older woman, who faced the untried future with her small
earnings in her pocket, her worldly goods in her trunk, and
hopeful determination in her heart to do some worth-while
thing in the world, for the sake of those she dearly loved.
She had started up the steep slope of her life's real adventuring,
and despite the rough paths over which she must
still travel before reaching her goal, she was more and more a
sympathetic comrade to the weak or weary, ever a gallant
soldier, and a noble woman, born to do great deeds. So
enthusiastic was she in playing her part in the world's work,
that when she was twenty-seven years old, and still toiling
on, with a scant measure of either wealth or fame, she
exclaimed at a small success:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! My story was accepted and Lowell asked if it
was not a translation from the German, it was so unlike
other tales. I felt much set up, and my fifty dollars will be
very happy money.... I have not been pegging away all
these years in vain, and I may yet have books and publishers,
and a fortune of my own. Success has gone to my head,
and I wander a little.</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven years old and very happy!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The prediction of "books, publishers and a fortune" came
true in 1868, when a Boston firm urged her to write a story
for girls, and she had the idea of describing the early life of
her own home, with its many episodes and incidents. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
wrote the book and called it <i>Little Women</i>, and was the most
surprised person in the world, when from her cozy corner of
Concord she watched edition after edition being published,
and found that she had become famous. From that moment
Louisa Alcott belonged to the public, and one has but
to turn to the pages of her ably edited <i>Life, Letters and
Journals</i>, to realize the source from which she got the material
for her "simple story of simple girls," bound by a beautiful
tie of family love, that neither poverty, sorrow nor
death could sever. Four little pilgrims, struggling onward
and upward through all the difficulties that beset them on
their way, in Concord, Boston, Walpole and elsewhere, had
provided human documents which the genius of Louisa
Alcott made into an imperishable story for the delight and
inspiration of succeeding generations of girls.</p>

<p><i>Little Women</i> was followed by <i>Little Men</i>, <i>Old Fashioned
Girl</i>, <i>Eight Cousins</i>, <i>Rose in Bloom</i>, <i>Under the Lilacs</i>, and a
long line of other charming books for young people. And,
although the incidents in them were not all taken from real
life as were those of her first "immortal," yet was each and
every book a faithful picture of every-day life. That is
where the genius of Louisa Alcott came in. From the
depicting of fairies and gnomes, princes and kings, she early
turned to paint the real, the vital and the heroic, which is
being lived in so many households where there is little
money and no luxury, but much light-hearted laughter,
tender affection for one another, and a deep and abiding
love of humanity.</p>

<p>Well may all aspiring young Americans take example
from the author of <i>Little Women</i>, and when longing to set
the world on fire in the expression of their genius, learn not
to despise or to turn away from the simple, commonplace
details of every-day life.</p>

<p>And for successful life and work, there is no better inspiration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
than the three rules given Louisa Alcott in girlhood for
her daily guidance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Rule yourself;<br />
Love your neighbor;<br />
Do the duty which lies nearest you.<br /></p>

<h2>CLARA MORRIS: THE GIRL WHO WON FAME
AS AN ACTRESS</h2>


<p>A certain young person who lived in a boarding-house
in the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was approaching her
thirteenth birthday, which fact made her feel very old, and
also very anxious to do some kind of work, as she saw her
mother busily engaged from morning to night, in an effort
to earn a living for her young daughter and herself.</p>

<p>Spring came in that year with furious heat, and the young
person, seeing her mother cruelly over-worked, felt hopelessly
big and helpless. The humiliation of having some
one working to support her&mdash;and with the dignity of thirteen
years close upon her, was more than she could bear. Locking
herself into her small room, she flung herself on her knees
and with a passion of tears prayed that God would help her.</p>

<p>"Dear God," she cried, "just pity me and show me what
to do. Please!" Her entreaty was that of the child who
has perfect confidence in the Father to whom she is speaking.
"Help me to help my mother. If you will, I'll never say 'No!'
to any woman who comes to me all my life long!"</p>

<p>In her story of her life, which the young person wrote
many years later, she says, in telling of that agonized plea:
"My error in trying to barter with my Maker must have been
forgiven, for my prayer was answered within a week....
I have tried faithfully to keep my part of the bargain, for
no woman who has ever sought my aid has ever been answered
with a 'No!'"</p>

<p>Somewhat relieved at having made known her longing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
to Some One whom she believed would understand and surely
help, the young person went through the dreary routine of
boarding-house days more cheerfully, to her mother's joy.
And at night, when she lay tossing and trying to sleep
despite the scorching heat, she seemed to be reviewing the
thirteen years of her existence as if she were getting ready
to pigeon-hole the past, to make ready for a fuller future.</p>

<p>With clear distinctness she remembered having been told
by her mother, in the manner of old-fashioned tellers, that,
"Once upon a time, in the Canadian city of Toronto, in the
year 1849, on the 17th of March&mdash;the day of celebrating the
birth of good old St. Patrick, in a quiet house not far from
the sound of the marching paraders, the rioting of revelers
and the blare of brass bands, a young person was born."
Memory carried on the story, as she lay there in the dark,
still hours of the night, and she repeated to herself the oft-told
tale of those few months she and her mother spent in
the Canadian city before they journeyed back to the United
States, where in Cleveland the mother tried many different
kinds of occupations by which to support the child and herself.
It was a strange life the young person remembered in
those early days. She and her mother had to flit so often&mdash;suddenly,
noiselessly. Often she remembered being roused
from a sound sleep, sometimes being simply wrapped up
without being dressed, and carried through the dark to
some other place of refuge. Then, too, when other children
walked in the streets or played, bare-headed or only with hat
on, she wore a tormenting and heavy veil over her face.
At an early age she began to notice that if a strange lady
spoke to her the mother seemed pleased, but if a man noticed
her she looked frightened, and hurried her away as fast as
possible. At first this was all a mystery to the child, but
later she understood that the great fear in her mother's
eyes, and the hasty flights, were all to be traced to a father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
who had not been good to the brave mother, and so she had
taken her little girl and fled from him. But he always found
her and begged for the child. Only too well the young person
remembered some of those scenes of frantic appeal on the
father's side, of angry refusal by her mother, followed always
by another hasty retreat to some new place of concealment.
At last&mdash;never-to-be forgotten day&mdash;there was a vivid recollection
of the time when the father asserted brutally that
"he would make life a misery to her until she gave up the
child"&mdash;that "by fair means or foul he would gain his end."
Soon afterward he did kidnap the young person, but the
mother was too quick for him, and almost immediately her
child was in her own arms again.</p>

<p>This necessary habit of concealment, and also the mother's
need to earn her own living, made life anything but an easy
matter for them both. The mother's terror lest her child be
taken from her again made her fear to allow the little girl
to walk out alone, even for a short distance, and in such
positions as the older woman was able to secure, it was always
with the promise that the child should be no nuisance.
And so the young person grew up in a habit of self-effacement,
and of sitting quietly in corners where she could not
be seen or heard, instead of playing with other children of
her own age. Then came a great hope, which even as she
lay in bed and thought about it, brought the tears to her
eyes, she had so longed to have it come true.</p>

<p>When she was six years old, she and her mother had been
living in a boarding-house in Cleveland, where there was a
good-natured actress boarding, who took such a fancy to
the shy little girl who was always sitting in a corner reading a
book, that one day she approached the astonished mother
with a proposition to adopt her daughter. Seeing surprise
on the mother's face, she frankly told of her position, her income
and her intention to give the girl a fine education. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
thought a convent school would be desirable, from then, say,
until the young person was seventeen.</p>

<p>The mother was really tempted by the offer of a good
education, which she saw no way to give her daughter, and
might have accepted it if the actress had not added:</p>

<p>"When she reaches the age of seventeen, I will place her
on the stage."</p>

<p>That ended the matter. The mother was horror-stricken,
and could hardly make her refusal clear and decided enough.
Even when her employer tried to make her see that by her
refusal she might be doing her daughter a great injustice, she
said, sharply: "It would be better for her to starve trying to
lead an honorable life, than to be exposed to such publicity
and such awful temptations." And thus, in ignorance of
what the future had in store for her child, did she close the
door on a golden opportunity for developing her greatest
talent, and the young person's first dream of freedom and a
fascinating career had come to grief. As she reviewed her
disappointment and the dreary days that followed, a flood
of self-pity welled up in the girl's heart, and she felt as if
she must do something desperate to quiet her restless nature.</p>

<p>Fortunately the disappointment was followed by a welcome
change of scene, for mother and daughter left Cleveland
and went to try their fortunes in what was then "the far
west." After a long trip by rail and a thirty-mile drive
across the prairie, they arrived at their journey's end, and
the marvelous quiet of the early May night in the country
soothed the older woman's sore heart and filled the child with
the joy of a real adventure.</p>

<p>They remained in that beautiful world beyond the prairie
for two years, and never did the charm of the backwoods's
life pall on the growing girl, who did not miss the city sights
and sounds, but exulted in the new experiences as, "with the
other children on the farm, she dropped corn in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
sun-warmed furrows, while a man followed behind with a hoe
covering it up; and when it had sprouted and was a tempting
morsel for certain black robbers of the field, she made a very
active and energetic young scarecrow."</p>

<p>While the out-of-door life was a fine thing for the young
person, still more to her advantage was it that she was now
thrown with other children, who were happy, hearty, rollicking
youngsters, and, seeing that the stranger was new to
farm-life, had rare fun at her expense. For instance, as she
later told:</p>

<p>"They led me forth to a pasture, shortly after our arrival
at the farm, and, catching a horse, they hoisted me up on to
its bare, slippery back. I have learned a good bit about
horses since then," she says, "have hired, borrowed and
bought them, but never since have I seen a horse of such
appalling aspect. His eyes were the size of soup-plates,
large clouds of smoke came from his nostrils. He had a
glass-enamelled surface, and if he was half as tall as he felt,
some museum manager missed a fortune. Then the young
fiends, leaving me on my slippery perch, high up near the sky,
drew afar off and stood against the fence, and gave me plenty
of room to fall off. But when I suddenly felt the world
heave up beneath me, I uttered a wild shriek&mdash;clenched my
hands in the animal's black hair and, madly flinging propriety
to any point of the compass that happened to be
behind me, I cast one pantalette over the enameled back,
and thus astride safely crossed the pasture&mdash;and lo, it was
not I who fell, but their faces instead! When they came to
take me down somehow the animal seemed shrunken, and I
hesitated about leaving it, whereupon the biggest boy said I
had 'pluck.' I had been frightened nearly to death, but
I always could be silent at the proper moment; I was silent
then, and he would teach me to ride sideways, for my mother
would surely punish me if I sat astride like that. In a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
weeks, thanks to him, I was the one who was oftenest trusted
to take the horses to water at noon, riding sideways and always
bare-back, mounted on one horse and leading a second
to the creek, until all had had their drink. Which habit
of riding&mdash;from balance&mdash;" the young person adds, "has
made me quite independent of stirrups since those far-away
days."</p>

<p>Besides the riding, there were many other delightful pastimes
which were a part of life on the farm, and on rainy
days, when the children could not play out of doors, they
would flock to the big barn, and listen eagerly to stories told
by the city girl, who had read them in books. Two precious
years passed all too swiftly on the farm, and the young person
was fast shooting up into a tall, slender girl, who had
learned a love of nature in all its forms, which never left her.
She had also grown stronger, which satisfied her mother
that the experiment had been successful. But now there
was education to be thought of, and when news came of
the death of that father, who had been the haunting
specter of the mother's life, they went back at once to Cleveland,
where the mother obtained employment, and the
growing daughter was sent to a public school. But at best it
gave a meager course of study to one who had always been a
reader of every book on which she could lay her hands.
To make the dreary, daily routine less tiresome, she supplemented
it by a series of "thinks." These usually took
place at night after her candle had been blown out, and the
young person generally fell asleep in a white robe and a crown
of flowers, before she had gathered up all the prizes and
diplomas and things she had earned in the world of reverie,
where her dream self had been roving.</p>

<p>And now came the approach of her thirteenth birthday,
and her plea that she might be made more useful in the
world. And then, came this:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
In the boarding-house where she and her mother were
living, the mother acting as assistant to the manager, the
young person occupied with enduring her monotonous existence
and with watching the boarders, there were two actresses,
a mother and daughter. The daughter, whose name
was Blanche, was only a year or two older than the young
person whose eyes followed her so eagerly, because Blanche
was one of those marvelous creatures whose real life was
lived behind the foot-lights.</p>

<p>Something in the silent, keen-eyed girl who was so near
her own age attracted Blanche, and the two became good
friends, spending many an hour together when the young
person was not in school. In exchange for her thrilling
stories of stage life, Blanche's new friend would tell vivid
tales which she had read in books, to all of which good-natured
Blanche would listen with lazy interest, and at the
finish of the narrative often exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You ought to be in a theater. You could act!"</p>

<p>Although this assertion was always met by determined
silence, as her friend thought she was being made fun of, yet
the young person did not fail to brood over the statement
when she was alone. Could there be any truth in the
statement, she wondered? Then came a marvelous event.
Blanche hurried home from the theater one day to tell her
young friend that extra ballet girls were wanted in their
company. She must go at once and get engaged.</p>

<p>"But," gasped the young person, "maybe they won't take
me!"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Blanche, "I've coaxed your mother, and
my mother says she'll look out for you&mdash;so at any rate, go
and see. I'll take you to-morrow."</p>

<p>To-morrow! "Dimly the agitated and awed young person
seemed to see a way opening out before her, and again
behind her locked door she knelt down and said 'Dear God!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Dear God!' and got no further, because grief has so many
words, and joy has so few."</p>

<p>That was Friday, and the school term had closed that day.
The next morning, with a heart beating almost to suffocation,
the young person found herself on the way to the
theater, with self-possessed Blanche, who led the way to the
old Academy of Music. Entering the building, the girls
went up-stairs, and as they reached the top step Blanche
called to a small, dark man who was hurrying across the hall:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Ellsler&mdash;wait a moment, please&mdash;I want to
speak to you."</p>

<p>The man stopped, but with an impatient frown, for as he
himself afterward said in relating the story:</p>

<p>"I was much put out about a business matter, and was
hastily crossing the corridor when Blanche called me, and I
saw she had another girl in tow, a girl whose appearance in a
theater was so droll I must have laughed had I not been
more than a little cross. Her dress was quite short&mdash;she
wore a pale-blue apron buttoned up the back, long braids
tied at the ends with ribbons, and a brown straw hat, while
she clutched desperately at the handle of the biggest umbrella
I ever saw. Her eyes were distinctly blue and big
with fright. Blanche gave her name, and said she wanted
to go in the ballet. I instantly answered that she was too
small&mdash;I wanted women, not children. Blanche was voluble,
but the girl herself never spoke a single word. I glanced
toward her and stopped. The hands that clutched the umbrella
trembled&mdash;she raised her eyes and looked at me. I
had noticed their blueness a moment before, now they were
almost black, so swiftly had their pupils dilated, and slowly
the tears rose in them. All the father in me shrank under
the child's bitter disappointment; all the actor in me thrilled
at the power of expression in the girl's face, and I hastily
added:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
"'Oh, well, you may come back in a day or two, and if
any one appears meantime who is short enough to march with
you, I'll take you on.' Not until I had reached my office
did I remember that the girl had not spoken a single word,
but had won an engagement&mdash;for I knew I should engage her&mdash;with
a pair of tear-filled eyes."</p>

<p>As a result of his half-promise, three days later, the young
person again presented herself at the theater, and was engaged
for the term of two weeks to go on the stage in the
marches and dances of a play called "The Seven Sisters,"
for which she was to receive the large sum of fifty cents a
night. She, who was later to be known as one of the great
emotional actresses of her day, whose name was to be on
every lip where the finest in dramatic art was appreciated,
had begun to mount the ladder toward fame and fortune.</p>

<p>Very curiously and cautiously she picked her way around
the stage at first, looking at the scenes, so fine on one side,
so bare and cheap on the other; at the tarletan "glass windows,"
at the green calico sea lying flat and waveless on the
floor. At last she asked Blanche:</p>

<p>"Is everything only make-believe in a theater?"</p>

<p>And Blanche, with the indifference of her lackadaisical
nature answered, "Yes, everything's make-believe, except
salary day."</p>

<p>Then came the novice's first rehearsal, which included a
Zouave drill to learn, as well as a couple of dances. She went
through her part with keen relish and learned the drill so
quickly that on the second day she sat watching the others,
while they struggled to learn the movements. As she sat
watching the star came along and angrily demanded,
"Why are you not drilling with the rest?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman sent me out of the ranks, sir," she answered,
"because he said I knew the manual and the drill."</p>

<p>The star refused to believe this and, catching up a rifle, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
cried: "Here, take hold, and let's see how much you know.
Now, then, shoulder arms!"</p>

<p>Standing alone, burning with blushes, blinded with tears
of mortification, she was put through her paces, but she
really did know the drill, and it was no small reward for her
misery when her persecutor took the rifle from her and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, saucer-eyes, you do know it! I'm sorry, little girl,
I spoke so roughly to you!" Holding out his hand to her, he
added, "You ought to stay in this business&mdash;you've got your
head with you!"</p>

<p>Stay in it! The question was would the manager want
her when the fatal night of her first stage appearance had
come and gone!</p>

<p>In those days of rehearsals, costumes were one of her most
vital interests; for a ballet girl's dress is most important, as
there is so little of it, that it must be perfect of its kind. The
ballet of which the young person was now a member were
supposed to be fairies in one dance. For the second act they
wore dancing-skirts, and for the Zouave drill, they wore the
regular Fire Zouave uniform.</p>

<p>At last, the first performance of the play came. It was a
very hot night, and so crowded was the tiny dressing-room
occupied by the ballet corps, that some of the girls had to
stand on the one chair while they put their skirts on. The
confusion was great, and the new-comer dressed as quickly
as possible, escaped down-stairs, and showed herself to
Blanche and her mother, to see if her make-up was all right.</p>

<p>To her surprise, after a moment of tense silence they both
burst into loud laughter, their eyes staring into her face. In
telling of that night later, she said; "I knew you had to put
on powder, because the gas made you yellow, and red because
the powder made you ghastly, but it had not occurred to me
that skill was required in applying the same, and I was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
sight to make any kindly disposed angel weep! I had not
even sense enough to free my eyelashes from the powder
clinging to them. My face was chalk white, and low down
on my cheeks were nice round, bright red spots.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bradshaw said: 'With your round blue eyes and
your round white and red face, you look like a cheap china
doll. Come here, my dear!'</p>

<p>"She dusted off a few thicknesses of the powder, removed
the hard red spots, and while she worked she remarked;
'To-morrow, after you have walked to get a color, go to your
glass and see where the color shows itself.... Of course,
when you are making up for a character part you go by a
different rule, but when you are just trying to look pretty,
be guided by Nature.' As she talked, I felt the soft touch
of a hare's foot on my burning cheeks and she continued her
work until my face was as it should be to make the proper
effect.</p>

<p>"That lesson was the beginning and the ending of my
theatrical instruction. What I learned later was learned by
observation, study, and direct inquiry&mdash;but never by instruction,
either free or paid for."</p>

<p>And now the moment of stage entry had arrived. "One
act of the play represented the back of a stage during a performance.
The scenes were turned around with their unpainted
sides to the audience. The scene-shifters and gas-men
were standing about; everything was supposed to be
going up. The manager was giving orders wildly, and then a
dancer was late. She was called frantically, and finally,
when she appeared on the run, the manager caught her by
the shoulders, rushed her across the stage, and fairly pitched
her onto the imaginary stage, to the great amusement of the
audience. The tallest and prettiest girl in the ballet had
been picked out to do this bit of work, and she had been rehearsed
day after day with the greatest care for the small part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
"All were gathered together ready for their first entrance
and dance, which followed a few moments after the scene
already described. The tall girl had a queer look on her
face as she stood in her place; her cue came, but she never
moved.</p>

<p>"I heard the rushing footsteps of the stage-manager;
'That's you,' he shouted; 'Go on! Go on! Run! Run!'
Run? She seemed to have grown fast to the floor....</p>

<p>"'Are you going on?' cried the frantic prompter.</p>

<p>"She dropped her arms limply at her sides and whispered;
'I&mdash;I&mdash;c-a-n't.'</p>

<p>"He turned, and as he ran his imploring eye over the line of
faces, each girl shrank back from it. He reached me. I had
no fear, and he saw it.</p>

<p>"'Can you go on there?' he cried. I nodded.</p>

<p>"'Then for God's sake go&mdash;go!'</p>

<p>"I gave a bound and a rush that carried me half across the
stage before the manager caught me, and so, I made my
first entrance on the stage, and danced and marched and
sang with the rest, and all unconsciously took my first
step on the path that I was to follow through shadow
and through sunshine&mdash;to follow by steep and stony places,
over threatening bogs, through green and pleasant meadows&mdash;to
follow steadily and faithfully for many and many a
year to come."</p>

<p>To the surprise of every one, when salary day came around
the new ballet girl did not go to claim her week's pay. Even
on the second she was the last one to appear at the box-office
window. Mr. Ellsler himself was there, and he opened
the door and asked her to come in. As she signed her name,
she paused so noticeably that he laughed, and said, "Don't
you know your own name?"</p>

<p>The fact was, on the first day of rehearsal, when the stage-manager
had taken down all names, he called out to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
latest comer, who was staring at the scenery and did not
hear him:</p>

<p>"Little girl, what is your name?"</p>

<p>Some one standing near him volunteered: "Her name is
Clara Morris, or Morrissey or Morrison, or something like
that." At once he had written down <i>Morris</i>&mdash;dropping the
last syllable from her rightful name. So when Mr. Ellsler
asked, "Don't you know your name?" it was the moment to
have set the matter straight, but the young person was far
too shy. She made no reply, but signed up and received
two weeks' salary as Clara Morris, by which name she was
known ever afterward.</p>

<p>In her story of life on the stage, she says, "After having
gratefully accepted my two weeks' earnings, Mr. Ellsler
asked me why I had not come the week before. I told him I
preferred to wait because it would seem so much more if I
got both weeks' salary all at one time. He nodded gravely,
and said, 'It was rather a large sum to have in hand at one
time,' and though I was very sensitive to ridicule, I did not
suspect him of making fun of me. Then he said:</p>

<p>"'You are a very intelligent little girl, and when you went
on alone and unrehearsed the other night, you proved you
had both adaptability and courage. I'd like to keep you in
the theater. Will you come and be a regular member of the
company for the season that begins in September next?'</p>

<p>"I think it must have been my ears that stopped my
ever-widening smile, while I made answer that I must ask
my mother first.</p>

<p>"'To be sure,' said he, 'to be sure! Well, suppose you
ask her then, and let me know whether you can or not.'"</p>

<p>She says, "Looking back and speaking calmly, I must
admit that I do not now believe Mr. Ellsler's financial future
depended entirely upon the yes or no of my mother and myself;
but that I was on an errand of life or death every one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
must have thought who saw me tearing through the streets
on that ninety-in-the-shade day.... One man ran out
hatless and coatless and looked anxiously up the street in
the direction from which I came. A big boy on the corner
yelled after me: 'Sa-ay, sis, where's the fire?' But, you see
they did not know that I was carrying home my first real
earnings, that I was clutching six damp one-dollar bills in
the hands that had been so empty all my life!</p>

<p>"I had meant to take off my hat and smooth my hair, and
with a proper little speech approach my mother, and then
hand her the money. But alas! as I rushed into the house I
came upon her unexpectedly, for, fearing dinner was going
to be late, she was hurrying things by shelling a great basket
of peas as she sat by the dining-room window. At sight of
her tired face all my nicely planned speech disappeared.
I flung my arm about her neck, dropped the bills on top of
the empty pods and cried:</p>

<p>"'Oh, mother, that's mine and it's all yours!'</p>

<p>"She kissed me, but to my grieved amazement put the
money back into my hand and said, 'No, you have earned
this money yourself&mdash;you are to do with it exactly as you
please.'"</p>

<p>And that was why, the next morning, a much-excited and
very rich young person took a journey to the stores, and as a
result bought a lavender-flowered muslin dress which, when
paid for, had made quite a large hole in the six dollars. By
her expression and manner she plainly showed how proud
and happy she was to be buying a dress for the mother who
for thirteen years had been doing and buying for two.
"Undoubtedly," says Miss Morris, "had there been a fire
just then I would have risked my life to save that flowered
muslin gown."</p>

<p>Up to that time, the only world Clara Morris had known
had been narrow and sordid, and lay chill under the shadow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of poverty.... Now, standing humbly at the knee of
Shakespeare, she began to learn something of another world&mdash;fairy-like
in fascination, marvelous in reality. A world of
sunny days and jeweled nights, of splendid palaces, caves,
of horrors, forests of mystery, and meadows of smiling candor.
All people, too, with such soldiers, statesmen, lovers,
clowns, such women of splendid honor, fierce ambition,
thistle-down lightness, as makes the heart beat fast to
think of.</p>

<p>That was the era of Shakesperian performances, and out
of twenty-eight stars who played with the support of Mr.
Ellsler's company, eighteen acted in the famous classic plays.
All stars played a week's engagement, some two, so at least
half of the season of forty-two weeks was given over to
Shakespeare's plays, and every actor and actress had his
lines at their tongues' tips, while there were endless discussions
about the best rendering of famous passages.</p>

<p>"I well remember," says Miss Morris, "my first step into
theatrical controversy. 'Macbeth' was being rehearsed,
and the star had just exclaimed: 'Hang out our banners on
the outward walls!' That was enough&mdash;argument was on.
It grew animated. Some were for: 'Hang out our banners!
On the outward walls the cry is still, they come!' while one
or two were with the star's reading.</p>

<p>"I stood listening, and looking on, and fairly sizzling with
hot desire to speak, but dared not take the liberty. Presently
an actor, noticing my eagerness, laughingly said:</p>

<p>"'Well, what is it, Clara? You'll have a fit if you don't
ease your mind with speech.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Uncle Dick,' I answered, my words fairly tripping
over one another in my haste, 'I have a picture home, I cut
out of a paper; it's a picture of a great castle with towers and
moats and things, and on the outer walls are men with spears
and shields, and they seem to be looking for the enemy, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Uncle Dick, the <i>banner</i> is floating over the high tower! So,
don't you think it ought to be read: "Hang out our banners!
On the outward walls"&mdash;the outward wall, you know, is
where the lookouts are standing&mdash;"the cry is still, they
come!"'</p>

<p>"A general laugh followed my excited explanation, but
Uncle Dick patted me on the shoulder and said:</p>

<p>"'Good girl, you stick to your picture&mdash;it's right, and so
are you. Many people read that line that way, but you have
worked it out for yourself, and that's a good plan to follow.'</p>

<p>"And," says Miss Morris, "I swelled and swelled, it
seemed to me, I was so proud of the gentle old man's approval.
But that same night I came woefully to grief. I had
been one of the crowd of 'witches.' Later, being off duty, I
was, as usual, planted in the entrance, watching the acting
of the grown-ups and grown-greats. Lady Macbeth was
giving the sleep-walking scene, in a way that jarred upon my
feelings. I could not have told why, but it did. I believed
myself alone, and when the memory-haunted woman roared
out:</p>

<p>"'Yet who would have thought the old man to have had
so much <i>blood</i> in him?' I remarked, under my breath. 'Did
you expect to find ink in him?'</p>

<p>"A sharp 'ahem' right at my shoulder told me I had been
overheard, and I turned to face&mdash;oh, horror! the stage-manager.
He glared angrily at me and demanded my ideas
on the speech, which in sheer desperation at last I gave,
saying:</p>

<p>"'I thought Lady Macbeth was amazed at the <i>quantity</i> of
blood that flowed from the body of such an old man&mdash;for
when you get old, you know, sir, you don't have so much
blood as you used to, and I only thought that, as the "sleeping
men were laced, and the knives smeared and her hands
bathed with it," she might perhaps have whispered, "Yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
who would have thought the old man to have so <i>much</i> blood
in him?"' I didn't mean an impertinence. Down fell the
tears, for I could not talk and hold them back at the same
time.</p>

<p>"He looked at me in dead silence for a few moments, then
he said: 'Humph!' and walked away, while I rushed to the
dressing-room and cried and cried, and vowed that never,
never again would I talk to myself&mdash;in the theater, at all
events.</p>

<p>"Only a short time afterward I had a proud moment when
I was allowed to go on as the longest witch in the caldron
scene in 'Macbeth.' Perhaps I might have come to grief
over it had I not overheard the leading man say: 'That
child will never speak those lines in the world!' And the
leading man was six feet tall and handsome, and I was thirteen
and a half years old, and to be called a child!</p>

<p>"I was in a secret rage, and I went over and over my lines
at all hours, under all circumstances, so that nothing should
be able to frighten me at night. And then, with my pasteboard
crown and white sheet and petticoat, I boiled up in
the caldron and gave my lines well enough for the manager
to say low:</p>

<p>"'Good! Good!' and the leading man next night asked me
to take care of his watch and chain during his combat
scene, and," says Miss Morris, "my pride of bearing was
unseemly, and the other girls loved me not at all, for, you
see, they, too, knew he was six feet tall and handsome."</p>

<p>The theatrical company of which Clara Morris had become
a member was what was called by the profession, a "family
theater," in which the best parts are apt to be absorbed by
the manager and his family, while all the poor ones are
placed with strict justice where they belong. At that time,
outside of the star who was being supported, men and
women were engaged each for a special line of business, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
which "line" they were strictly kept. However much the
"family theater" was disliked by her comrades in the profession,
it was indeed an ideal place for a young girl to begin
her stage life in. The manager, Mr. Ellsler, was an excellent
character actor; his wife, Mrs. Ellsler, was his leading
woman&mdash;his daughter, Effie, though not out of school at that
time, acted whenever there was a very good part that suited
her. Other members of the company were mostly related
in some way, and so it came about that there was not even
the "pink flush of a flirtation over the first season," in fact,
says Miss Morris, "during all the years I served in that old
theater, no real scandal ever smirched it." She adds: "I can
never be grateful enough for having come under the influence
of the dear woman who watched over me that first season,
Mrs. Bradshaw, the mother of Blanche, one of the most
devoted actresses I ever saw, and a good woman besides.
From her I learned that because one is an actress it is not
necessary to be a slattern. She used to say:</p>

<p>"'You know at night the hour of morning rehearsal&mdash;then
get up fifteen minutes earlier, and leave your room in order.
Everything an actress does is commented on, and as she is
more or less an object of suspicion, her conduct should be
even more correct than that of other women.' She also
repeated again and again, 'Study your lines&mdash;speak them
just as they are written. Don't just gather the idea of a
speech, and then use your own words&mdash;that's an infamous
habit. The author knew what he wanted you to say. If he
says, "My lord, the carriage waits," don't you go on and say,
"My lord, the carriage is waiting!"'"</p>

<p>These and many other pieces of valuable advice were
stored up in Clara Morris's mind, and she made such good
use of them that they bore rich fruit in later years.</p>

<p>There was great consternation for mother and daughter,
on a certain day when Clara brought home the startling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
news that the company was to be transferred to Columbus,
Ohio, for the remainder of the season. It was a great event
in the young actress's life, as it meant leaving her mother
and standing alone. But as she confesses: "I felt every now
and then my grief and fright pierced through and through
with a delicious thrill of importance; I was going to be just
like a grown-up, and would decide for myself what I should
wear. I might even, if I chose to become so reckless, wear
my Sunday hat to a rehearsal, and when my cheap little
trunk came, with C. M. on the end, showing it was my very
own, I stooped down and hugged it." But she adds with
honesty, "Later, when my mother, with a sad face, separated
my garments from her own, I burst into sobs of utter forlornness."</p>

<p>The salary of the ballet corps was now raised to $5 a week,
and all set to work to try to solve the riddle of how a girl
was to pay her board bill, her basket bill, her washing bill,
and all the small expenses of the theater&mdash;powder, paint,
soap, hair-pins, etc.&mdash;to say nothing of shoes and clothing, out
of her earnings. Clara Morris and the Bradshaws solved the
problem in the only possible way by rooming together in a
large top-floor room, where they lived with a comparative
degree of comfort, and with less loneliness for Clara than she
could have felt elsewhere.</p>

<p>During that first season she learned to manage her affairs
and to take care of herself and her small belongings,
without admonition from any one. At the same time
she was learning much of the technique of the profession,
and was deeply interested as she began to understand
how illusions are produced. She declares that one of the
proofs that she was meant to be an actress was her enjoyment
of the mechanism of stage effects.</p>

<p>"I was always on hand when a storm had to be worked,"
she says, "and would grind away with a will at a crank that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
turning against a tight band of silk, made the sound of a tremendously
shrieking wind. And no one sitting in front of
the house, looking at a white-robed woman ascending
to heaven, apparently floating upward through the blue
clouds, enjoyed the spectacle more than I enjoyed looking at
the ascent from the rear, where I could see the tiny iron support
for her feet, the rod at her back with the belt holding
her securely about the waist, and the men hoisting her
through the air, with a painted, sometimes moving sky
behind her.</p>

<p>"This reminds me," says Miss Morris, "that Mrs. Bradshaw
had several times to go to heaven (dramatically
speaking), and as her figure and weight made the support
useless, she always went to heaven on the entire gallery, as
it is called, a long platform the whole width of the stage,
which is raised and lowered by windlass. The enormous
affair would be cleaned and hung about with nice white
clouds, and then Mrs. Bradshaw, draped in long white robes,
with hands meekly crossed upon her breast and eyes piously
uplifted, would rise heavenward, slowly, as so heavy an
angel should. But alas! There was one drawback to this
otherwise perfect ascension. Never, so long as the theater
stood, could that windlass be made to work silently. It always
moved up or down to a succession of screaks, unoilable,
blood-curdling, that were intensified by Mrs. Bradshaw's
weight, so that she ascended to the blue tarletan heaven
accompanied by such chugs and long-drawn yowlings as
suggested a trip to the infernal regions. Her face remained
calm and unmoved, but now and then an agonized moan
escaped her, lest even the orchestra's effort to cover up the
support's protesting cries should prove useless. Poor
woman, when she had been lowered again to <i>terra firma</i> and
stepped off, the whole paint frame would give a kind of
joyous upward spring. She noticed it, and one evening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
looked back and said; 'Oh, you're not one bit more glad
than I am, you screaking wretch!'"</p>

<p>Having successfully existed through the Columbus season,
in the spring the company was again in Cleveland, playing
for a few weeks before disbanding for that horror of all
theatrical persons&mdash;the summer vacation.</p>

<p>As her mother was in a position, and could not be with
Clara, the young actress spent the sweltering months in a
cheap boarding-house, where a kindly landlady was willing
to let her board bill run over until the fall, when salaries
should begin again. Clara never forgot that kindness, for
she was in real need of rest after her first season of continuous
work. Although her bright eyes, clear skin, and round face
gave an impression of perfect health, yet she was far from
strong, owing partly to the privations of her earlier life and
to a slight injury to her back in babyhood. Because of this,
she was facing a life of hard work handicapped by that most
cruel of torments, a spinal trouble, which an endless number
of different treatments failed to cure.</p>

<p>Vacation ended, to her unspeakable joy she began work
again as a member of the ballet corps, and during that season
and the next her ability to play a part at short notice came
to be such an accepted fact that more than once she was
called on for work outside of her regular "line," to the envy
of the other girls, who began to talk of "Clara's luck."
"But," says Clara, "there was no luck about it. My small
success can be explained in two words&mdash;extra work."
While the others were content if they could repeat a part perfectly
to themselves in their rooms, that was only the beginning
of work to their more determined companion. "I
would repeat those lines," said Miss Morris, "until, had the
very roof blown off the theater at night, I should not have
missed one." And so it was that the youngest member of
the ballet corps came to be looked on as a general-utility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
person, who could be called on at a moment's notice to play
the part of queen or clown, boy or elderly woman, as was
required.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellsler considered that the young girl had a real gift for
comedy, and when Mr. Dan Setchell, the comedian, played
with the company, she was given a small part, which she
played with such keen perception of the points where a "hit"
could be made, that at last the audience broke into a storm
of laughter and applause. Mr. Setchell had another speech,
but the applause was so insistent that he knew it would be an
anti-climax and signaled the prompter to ring down the
curtain. But Clara Morris knew that he ought to speak,
and was much frightened by the effect of her business, which
had so captured the fancy of the audience, for she knew that
the applause belonged to the star as a matter of professional
etiquette. She stood trembling like a leaf, until the comedian
came and patted her kindly on the shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, my girl&mdash;that applause was for you.
You won't be fined or scolded&mdash;you've made a hit, that's all!"</p>

<p>But even the pleasant words did not soothe the tempest of
emotion surging in the young girl's heart. She says:</p>

<p>"I went to my room, I sat down with my head in my
hands. Great drops of sweat came out on my temples.
My hands were icy cold, my mouth was dry&mdash;that applause
rang in my ears. A cold terror seized on me&mdash;a terror of
what? Ah, a tender mouth was bitted and bridled at last!
The reins were in the hands of the public, and it would
drive me, where?"</p>

<p>As she sat there, in her hideous make-up, in a state of
despair and panic, she suddenly broke into shrill laughter.
Two women came in, and one said; "Why, what on earth's
the matter? Have they blown you up for your didoes to-night?
What need you care. You pleased the audience."
The other said, quietly: "Just get a glass of water for her;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
she has a touch of hysteria. I wonder who caused it?" No
person had caused it. Clara Morris was merely waking
from a sound sleep, unconsciously visioning that woman of
the dim future who was to conquer the public in her portrayal
of great elemental human emotion.</p>

<p>With incessant work and study, and a firm determination
to stop short of nothing less than the perfection of art,
those early years of Clara Morris's life on the stage went
swiftly by, and in her third season she was more than ever
what she herself called "the dramatic scrape-goat of the
company," one who was able to play any part at a moment's
notice.</p>

<p>"This reputation was heightened when one day, an actor
falling suddenly sick, Mr. Ellsler, with a furrowed brow,
begged Clara to play the part. Nothing daunted, the
challenge was calmly accepted, and in one afternoon she
studied the part of King Charles, in 'Faint Heart Never
Won Fair Lady,' and played it in borrowed clothes and without
any rehearsal whatever, other than finding the situations
plainly marked in the book! It was an astonishing thing to
do, and she was showered with praise for the performance;
but even this success did not better her fortunes, and she
went on playing the part of boys and old women, or singing
songs when forced to it, going on for poor leading parts even,
and between times dropping back into the ballet, standing
about in crowds, or taking part in a village dance."</p>

<p>It was certainly an anomalous position she held in Mr.
Ellsler's company&mdash;but she accepted its ups and downs
without resistance, taking whatever part came to hand,
gaining valuable experience from every new r&ocirc;le assigned
her, and hoping for a time when the returns from her work
would be less meager.</p>

<p>She was not yet seventeen when the German star, Herr
Daniel Bandmann, came to play with the company. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
to open with "Hamlet," and Mrs. Bradshaw, who by right
should have played the part of Queen Mother, was laid
up with a broken ankle. Miss Morris says: "It took a good
deal in the way of being asked to do strange parts to startle
me, but the Queen Mother did it. I was just nicely past
sixteen, and I was to go on the stage for the serious Shakesperian
mother of a star. Oh, I couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Can't be helped&mdash;no one else," growled Mr. Ellsler;
"Just study your lines, right away, and do the best you can."</p>

<p>"I had been brought up to obey," says Miss Morris, "and
I obeyed. The dreaded morning of rehearsal came. There
came a call for the Queen. I came forward. Herr Bandmann
glanced at me, half smiled, waved his arms, and said,
'Not you, not the <i>Player-Queen</i>, but GERTRUDE.'</p>

<p>"I faintly answered, 'I'm sorry, sir, but I have to play
Gertrude!'</p>

<p>"'Oh no, you won't!' he cried, 'not with me!' Then,
turning to Mr. Ellsler, he lost his temper and only controlled
it when he was told that there was no one else to take
the part; if he would not play with me, the theater must be
closed for the night. Then he calmed down and condescended
to look the girl over who was to play such an inappropriate
r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>"The night came&mdash;a big house, too, I remember," says
Miss Morris. "I wore long and loose garments to make me
look more matronly, but, alas, the drapery Queen Gertrude
wears was particularly becoming to me and brought me
uncommonly near to prettiness. Mr. Ellsler groaned, but
said nothing, while Mr. Bandmann sneered out an '<i>Ach
Himmel!</i>' and shrugged his shoulders, as if dismissing the
matter as hopeless."</p>

<p>But it was not. "As Bandmann's great scene advanced to
its climax, so well did the young Queen Mother play up to
Hamlet, that the applause was rapturous. The curtain fell,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and to her utter amaze she found herself lifted high in the
air and crushed to Hamlet's bosom, with a crackling sound
of breaking Roman pearls and in a whirlwind of German
exclamations, kissed on brow, cheeks and eyes. Then disjointed
English came forth; 'Oh, you are so great, you
<i>kleine</i> apple-cheeked girl! You maker of the fraud&mdash;you so
great, nobody. <i>Ach</i>, you are fire&mdash;you have pride&mdash;you are
a Gertrude who have shame!' More kisses, then suddenly
realizing that the audience was still applauding, he dragged
her before the curtain, he bowed, he waved his hands, he
threw one arm around my shoulders. 'He isn't going to do
it all over again&mdash;out here, is he?' thought the victim of his
enthusiasm, and began backing out of sight as quickly as
possible."</p>

<p>That amusing experience led to one of the most precious
memories of Clara Morris's career, when, a month after the
departure of the impetuous German, who should be announced
to play with the company but Mr. Edwin Booth.
As Clara Morris read the cast of characters, she says, "I
felt my eyes growing wider as I saw&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Queen Gertrude</span>............Miss Morris.<br /></p>
</div>

<p>"I had succeeded before, oh yes, but this was a different
matter. All girls have their gods&mdash;some have many of
them. My gods were few, and on the highest pedestal of all,
grave and gentle, stood the god of my professional idolatry&mdash;Edwin
Booth. It was humiliating to be forced on any one as
I should be forced upon Mr. Booth, since there was still none
but my 'apple-cheeked' self to go on for the Queen, and
though I dreaded complaint and disparaging remarks from
him, I was honestly more unhappy over the annoyance this
blemish on the cast would cause him. But it could not be
helped, so I wiped my eyes, repeated my childish little old-time
'Now I lay me,' and went to sleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
"The dreaded Monday came, and at last&mdash;the call, 'Mr.
Booth would like to see you for a few moments in his room.'</p>

<p>"He was dressed for Hamlet when I entered. He looked
up, smiled, and, waving his hand, said in Bandmann's very
words: 'No, not you&mdash;not the <i>Player-Queen</i>&mdash;but GERTRUDE.'</p>

<p>"My whole heart was in my voice as I gasped: 'I'm so
sorry, sir, but I have to do Queen Gertrude. You see,' I
rushed on, 'our heavy woman has a broken leg and can't act.
But if you please,' I added, 'I had to do this part with Mr.
Bandmann, too, and&mdash;and&mdash;I'll only worry you with my
looks, sir, not about the words or business.'</p>

<p>"He rested his dark, unspeakably melancholy eyes on my
face, then he sighed and said: 'Well, it was the closet scene
I wanted to speak to you about. When the ghost appears
you are to be&mdash;' He stopped, a faint smile touched his
lips, and he remarked:</p>

<p>"'There's no denying it, my girl, I look a great deal more
like your father than you look like my mother&mdash;but&mdash;' He
went on with his directions, and, considerate gentlemen that
he was, spoke no single unkind word to me, though my playing
of that part must have been a great annoyance to him.</p>

<p>"When the closet scene was over, the curtain down, I
caught up my petticoats and made a rapid flight roomward.
The applause was filling the theater. Mr. Booth, turning,
called after me: 'You&mdash;er&mdash;Gertrude&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Queen!</i> Oh,
somebody call that child back here!' and somebody roared,
'Clara, Mr. Booth is calling you!' I turned, but stood still.
He beckoned, then came and took my hand, saying, 'My
dear, we must not keep them waiting too long,' and led me
before the curtain with him. I very slightly bent my head
to the audience, whom I felt were applauding Hamlet only,
but turned and bowed myself to the ground to him whose
courtesy had brought me there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
"When we came off he smiled amusedly, tapped me on the
shoulder, and said: 'My Gertrude, you are very young, but
you know how to pay a pretty compliment&mdash;thank you,
child!'</p>

<p>"So," says Miss Morris, "whenever you see pictures of
nymphs or goddesses floating in pink clouds and looking
idiotically happy, you can say to yourself: 'That is just
how Clara Morris felt when Edwin Booth said she had paid
him a compliment.' Yes, I floated, and I'll take a solemn
oath, if necessary, that the whole theater was filled with
pink clouds the rest of that night, for girls are made that way,
and they can't help it."</p>

<p>The young actress was now rapidly acquiring a knowledge
of her ability to act; she also knew that as long as she remained
with Mr. Ellsler there would be no advancement for
her, and a firm determination took possession of her to take a
plunge into the big world, where perhaps there might be a
chance not only to earn enough to take care of herself, but
also enough so that her mother would no longer be obliged
to work, which was Clara's bitter mortification.</p>

<p>While she was considering the advisability of making a
change, she received an offer from a Mr. Macaulay,
manager of Wood's Museum, at Cincinnati, Ohio. He
offered a small salary, but as she was to be his leading woman
she decided to accept the offer. "When the matter was
apparently settled, he wrote, saying that 'because of the
youth of his new star, he wished to reserve a few parts which
his wife would act.' Only too well did Clara Morris understand
what that meant&mdash;that the choicest parts would be
reserved. Then an amusing thing happened. She, who
was so lacking in self-confidence, suddenly developed an
ability to stand up for her rights. By return mail she
informed Mr. Macaulay that her youth had nothing to do
with the matter&mdash;that she would be the leading woman and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
play all parts or none. His reply was a surprise, as it contained
a couple of signed contracts and a pleasant request to
sign both and return one at once. He regretted her inability
to grant his request, but closed by expressing his
respect for her firmness in demanding her rights. Straightway
she signed her first contract, and went out to mail it.
When she returned she had made up her mind to take a great
risk. She had decided that her mother should never again
receive commands from any one&mdash;that her shoulders were
strong enough to bear the welcome burden, that they would
face the new life and its possible sufferings together&mdash;<i>together</i>,
that was the main thing." She says:</p>

<p>"As I stood before the glass smoothing my hair, I gravely
bowed to the reflection and said, 'Accept my congratulations
and best wishes, Wood's leading lady!'&mdash;and then fell
on the bed and sobbed ... because, you see, the way had
been so long and hard, but I had won one goal&mdash;I was a leading
woman!"</p>

<p>Leaving behind the surroundings of so many years was
not a light matter, nor was the parting with the Ellslers, of
whose theatrical family she had been a member for so long,
easy. When the hour of leave-taking came, she was very
sad. She had to make the journey alone, as her mother
also was to join her only when she had found a place to settle
in. Mr. Ellsler was sick for the first time since she had known
him. She said good-by to him in his room, and left feeling
very despondent, he seemed so weak. "Judge then," says
Miss Morris, "my amazement when, hearing a knock on my
door and calling, 'Come in'&mdash;Mr. Ellsler, pale and almost
staggering, entered. A rim of red above his white muffler
betrayed his bandaged throat, and his poor voice was but
a husky whisper:</p>

<p>"'I could not help it,' he said. 'You were placed under
my care once by your mother. You were a child then, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
though you are pleased to consider yourself a woman now,
I could not bear to think of your leaving the city without
some old friend being by for a parting God-speed.'</p>

<p>"I was inexpressibly grateful, but he had yet another
surprise for me. He said, 'I wanted, too, Clara, to
make you a little present that would last long and remind
you daily of&mdash;of&mdash;er&mdash;the years you have passed in my
theater.'</p>

<p>"He drew a small box from his pocket. 'A good girl and
a good actress,' he said, 'needs and ought to own a'&mdash;he
touched a spring, the box flew open&mdash;'a good watch,' he
finished.</p>

<p>"Literally, I could not speak, having such agony of delight
in its beauty, of pride in its possession, of satisfaction in a
need supplied, of gratitude and surprise immeasurable.
'Oh!' and again 'Oh!' was all that I could cry, while I
pressed it to my cheek and gloated over it. My thanks
must have been sadly jumbled and broken, but my pride
and pleasure made Mr. Ellsler laugh, and then the carriage
was there, and laughter stilled into a silent, close hand-clasp.
As I opened the door of the dusty old hack, I saw the first
star prick brightly through the evening sky. Then the
hoarse voice said, 'God bless you'&mdash;and I had left my first
manager."</p>

<p>To say that Clara Morris made a success in Cincinnati is
the barest truth. Her first appearance was in the r&ocirc;le of a
country girl, <i>Cicely</i>, a simple milkmaid with only one speech
to make, but one which taxed the ability of an actress to the
uttermost to express what was meant. Clara played this
part in a demure black-and-white print gown, with a little
hat tied down under her chin. On the second night, she
played what is called a "dressed part," a bright, light-comedy
part in which she wore fine clothes; on the third
night hers was a "tearful" part. In three nights she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
completely won the public, and on the third she received her
first anonymous gift, a beautiful and expensive set of pink
corals set in burnished gold. "Flowers, too, came over the
foot-lights, the like of which she had never seen before, some
of them costing more than she earned in a week. Then one
night came a bolder note with a big gold locket, which,
having its sender's signature, went straight back to him the
next morning. As a result it began to be whispered about
that the new star sent back all gifts of jewelry; but when one
matin&eacute;e a splendid basket of white camelias came with a
box of French candied fruit, it delighted her and created a
sensation in the dressing-room. That seemed to start a
fashion, for candies in dainty boxes came to her afterward
as often as flowers."</p>

<p>On the night of her first appearance, a lawyer of Cincinnati
who saw her play the part of Cicely was so delighted
with her interpretation of the small r&ocirc;le that he at once
asked: "Who is she? What is her history?"&mdash;only to find
that, like most happy women, she had none. She came from
Cleveland, she lived three doors away with her mother&mdash;that
was all.</p>

<p>Having seen her a second time, he exclaimed, "That girl
ought to be in New York this very moment!" and he added,
"I know the foreign theaters&mdash;their schools and styles, as
well as I know the home theaters and their actors. I
believe I have made a discovery!"</p>

<p>After seeing her in the "tearful part," he said firmly: "I
shall never rest till this Clara Morris faces New York. She
need clash with no one, need hurt no one, she is unlike any
one else, and New York has plenty of room for her. I shall
make it my business to meet her and preach New York until
she accepts the idea and acts upon it."</p>

<p>As a result of that determination, at a later date, he met
the object of his interest and roused her to such an enthusiasm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
in his New York project that she wrote to Mr. Ellsler, begging
his aid in reaching New York managers, and one day,
shortly afterward, she held in her hand a wee sheet of paper,
containing two lines scrawled in an illegible handwriting:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If you send the young woman to me, I will willingly
consider proposal. Will engage no actress without seeing
her.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Daly</span>."</p></div>

<p>It was a difficult proposition, for to obtain leave of absence
she would be obliged to pay a substitute for at least two
performances&mdash;would have to stop for one night at a New
York hotel, and so spend what she had saved toward a summer
vacation. But the scheme was too compelling to be set
aside. That very night she asked leave of absence, made
all other necessary arrangements, and before she had time to
falter in her determination found herself at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel in the great bustling city of her dreams. She breakfasted,
and took from her bag a new gray veil, a pair of gray
gloves and a bit of fresh ruffling. Then, having made all
the preparation she could to meet the arbiter of her fate, in
her usual custom she said a prayer to that Father in whose
protecting care she had an unfaltering trust. Then, she
says, "I rose and went forth, prepared to accept success or
defeat, just as the good Lord should will."</p>

<p>Having found Mr. Daly, she looked bravely into his eyes
and spoke with quick determination to lose no time: "I am
the girl come out of the West to be inspected. I'm Clara
Morris!"</p>

<p>That was the preface to an interview which ended in his
offer to engage her, but without a stated line of business.
He would give her thirty-five dollars a week, he said (knowing
there were two to live on it), and if she made a favorable
impression he would double that salary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
A poor offer&mdash;a risky undertaking, exclaimed Clara. "In
my pocket was an offer which I had received just before
leaving for New York, from a San Francisco manager, with a
salary of one hundred dollars, a benefit, and no vacation at
all, unless I wished it. This offer was fairly burning a hole
in my pocket as I talked with Mr. Daly, who, while we
talked, was filling up a blank contract, for my signature.
Thirty-five dollars against one hundred dollars. 'But if you
make a favorable impression you'll get seventy dollars.'
I thought, and why should I <i>not</i> make a favorable impression?
Yet, if I fail now in New York, I can go West or
South not much harmed. If I wait till I am older and
fail, it will ruin my life. I slipped my hand in my pocket
and gave a little farewell tap to the contract for one
hundred dollars; I took the pen; I looked hard at him.
'There's a heap of trust asked for in this contract,' I
remarked. 'You won't forget your promise about doubling
the contract?'</p>

<p>"'I won't forget anything,' he answered.</p>

<p>"Then I wrote 'Clara Morris' twice, shook hands, and
went out and back to Cincinnati, with an engagement in a
New York theater for the coming season."</p>

<p>As the tangible results of a benefit performance Clara was
able to give her mother a new spring gown and bonnet and
send her off to visit in Cleveland, before turning her face
toward Halifax, where she had accepted a short summer
engagement. At the end of it she went on to New York,
engaged rooms in a quiet old-fashioned house near the theater,
and telegraphed her mother to come. "She came,"
says Miss Morris, "and that blessed evening found us housekeeping
at last. We were settled, and happily ready to
begin the new life in the great, strange city."</p>

<p>From that moment, through the frenzied days of rehearsal
with a new company, and with a large number of untoward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
incidents crowded into each day, life moved swiftly on
toward the first appearance of Clara Morris on the New York
stage.</p>

<p>With a sort of dogged despair she lived through the worry
of planning how to buy costumes out of her small reserve
fund. When at last all her gowns were ready, she had two
dollars and thirty-eight cents left, on which she and her
mother must live until her first week's salary should be paid.
Worse than that, on the last awful day before the opening
night she had a sharp attack of pleurisy. A doctor was
called, who, being intoxicated, treated the case wrongly.
Another physician had to be summoned to undo the work
of the first, and as a result Daly's new actress was in a condition
little calculated to give her confidence for such an
ordeal as the coming one. She says, "I could not swallow
food&mdash;<i>I could not!</i> As the hour drew near my mother stood
over me while with tear-filled eyes I disposed of a raw beaten
egg; then she forced me to drink a cup of broth, fearing a
breakdown if I tried to go through five such acts as awaited
me without food. I always kissed her good-by, and that
night my lips were so cold and stiff with fright that they
would not move. I dropped my head for one moment on
her shoulder; she patted me silently with one hand and
opened the door with the other. I glanced back. Mother
waved her hand and called: 'Good luck! God bless you!'
and I was on my way to my supreme test."</p>

<p>A blaze of lights, a hum of voices, a brilliant throng of
exquisitely gowned, bejeweled women and well-groomed
men, in fact a house such as Wood's leading lady had never
before confronted! A chance for triumph or for disaster&mdash;and
triumph it was! Like a rolling snowball, it grew as the
play advanced. Again and again Clara Morris took a curtain
call with the other actresses. Finally the stage manager
said to Mr. Daly, "They want <i>her</i>," and Mr. Daly answered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
sharply: "I know what they want, and I know what I don't
want. Ring up again!"</p>

<p>He did so. But it was useless. At last Mr. Daly said,
"Oh, well, ring up once more, and here, you take it yourself."</p>

<p>Alone, Clara Morris stood before the brilliant throng,
vibrating to the spontaneous storm of enthusiasm, and as she
stood before them the audience rose as one individual, carried
out of themselves by an actress whose work was as rare
as it was unique&mdash;work which never for one moment descended
to mere stagecraft, but in its simplest gesture was
throbbing with vital human emotion.</p>

<p>As the curtain fell at last, while there was a busy hum
of excited voices, the young person whose place on the
New York stage was assured slipped into her dressing-room,
scrambled into her clothes, and rushed from the theater,
hurrying to carry the good news to the two who were eagerly
awaiting her&mdash;her mother and her dog. "At last she saw the
lighted windows that told her home was near. In a moment,
through a tangle of hat, veil, and wriggling, welcoming dog,
she cried:</p>

<p>"'It's all right, mumsey&mdash;a success! Lots and lots of
"calls," dear, and, oh, is there anything to eat? <i>I am so
hungry!</i>'</p>

<p>"So while the new actress's name was floating over many a
restaurant supper its owner sat beneath one gas-jet, between
mother and pet, eating a large piece of bread and a
small piece of cheese, telling her small circle of admirers all
about it, and winding up with the declaration, 'Mother, I
believe the hearts are just the same, whether they beat
against Western ribs or Eastern ribs!'"</p>

<p>Then, supper over, she stumbled through the old-time
'Now I lay me,' and, adding some blurred words of gratitude,
she says, "I fell asleep, knowing that through God's
mercy and my own hard work I was the first Western actress
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
who had ever been accepted by a New York audience, and
as I drowsed off I murmured to myself:</p>

<p>"'And I'll leave the door open, now that I have opened it&mdash;I'll
leave it open for all the others.'"</p>

<p>She did. Through that open door has passed a long procession
from West to East since the day when the young
woman from Cleveland brought New York to her feet by her
unique ability and dramatic perception. A lover of literature
from childhood, a writer of books in later days, Clara
Morris moved on through the years of her brilliant dramatic
career to a rare achievement, not led by the lure of the foot-lights
or the flimsier forms of so-called dramatic art, but by
the call of the highest.</p>

<p>Well may the matin&eacute;e girl of to-day, or the stage-struck
young person who responds to the glitter and glare, the applause
and the superficial charm of the theatrical world,
listen to Miss Morris's story of "Life on the Stage," and
realize that laurels only crown untiring effort, success only
comes after patient labor, and great emotional actresses
come to their own through the white heat of sacrifice,
struggle, and supreme desire.</p>

<h2>ANNA DICKINSON: THE GIRL ORATOR</h2>


<p>A very well-known lawyer of Philadelphia was sitting
in his private office one morning when word was
brought in to him that a young lady wished to see him. The
office-boy had never seen her before, and she had not given
her name, but she was very firm in her intention not to be
refused an interview.</p>

<p>"Show her in," said the lawyer, pushing back his chair
with a bored expression and a resolution to send the stranger
away at short notice if she was not a client. What was his
surprise when a very young girl, still wearing short dresses,
was ushered in, and stood before him with such an earnest
expression in her bright eyes that she instantly attracted
him. Motioning her to take a seat, he asked her errand.</p>

<p>"I wish some copying to do," was the reply, in such a
musical voice that the lawyer became still more interested.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to do it yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p>She bowed assent. "Yes," she said. "We are in need of
money and I must help. I write a clear hand."</p>

<p>So pleased was he with her manner and her quiet words,
"We are in need of money and I must help," as well as
touched by her self-reliance at an age when girls are generally
amusing themselves, that he gave her some copying which he
had intended to have done in the office. With a grateful
glance from her brilliant dark eyes, she thanked him, and,
promising to bring the work back as soon as possible, she left
the office.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her the lawyer opened a drawer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and took from it a little faded photograph of a young girl
with dark eyes and curly hair, looked at it long and sadly,
then replaced it in the drawer and went on with his work.</p>

<p>On the following day, when the office-boy announced "the
young lady with the copying," she was summoned to his
office at once and given a hearty hand-clasp.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you again," the lawyer said. "I had a
daughter you remind me of strongly. She died when she
was twelve years old. Be seated, please, and tell me a little
about yourself. You are very young to be doing such work
as this. Is your father living, and why are you not in
school?"</p>

<p>Compelled by his kindly interest, the young girl talked
as freely with him as if he were an old friend. Her name,
she said, was Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, and she was born
in Philadelphia, thirteen years before, on the 28th of October.
Her father, John Dickinson, and her mother, who had been
Mary Edmundson before her marriage, were both persons
who were interested in the vital questions of the day, and
Anna had been brought up in an atmosphere of refinement
and of high principles. All this her new friend learned by a
series of friendly questions, and Anna, having begun her
story, continued with a degree of frankness which was little
less than surprising, after so short an acquaintance. Her
father had been a merchant, and had died when she was two
years old, leaving practically no income for the mother to
live on and bring up her five children. Both mother and
father were Quakers, she said, and she was evidently very
proud of her father, for her eyes flashed as she said: "He was
a wonderful man! Of course, I can't remember it, but
mother has told me that the last night of his life, when he
was very sick, he went to an anti-slavery meeting and made a
remarkably fine speech. Yes, father was wonderful."</p>

<p>"And your mother?" queried her new friend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Tears dimmed the young girl's eyes. "There aren't any
words to express mother," she said. "That is why I am
trying to work at night, or at least part of the reason," she
added, with frank honesty. "We take boarders and mother
teaches in a private school, too, but even that doesn't give
enough money for six of us to live on, and she is so pale and
tired all the time." She added, with a toss of her curly
head: "And I must have money to buy books, too, but
helping mother is more important."</p>

<p>Entirely absorbed in her own narrative now, she continued
to pour out a flood of facts with such an eloquence and persuasive
use of words that her hearer was lost in amazement
over a young girl who was so fluent in her use of language.
From her frank tale he gathered that she had been a wayward,
wilful, intense, and very imaginative child, who, despite
her evident devotion to her mother, had probably given her
many hours of worry and unhappiness. It was evident also
that as a younger child she had been considered an incorrigible
pupil at school, for she seemed to have always rebelled
against discipline which she thought unnecessary.</p>

<p>"They could punish me all they liked," she said, with
flashing eyes. "I would never obey a rule that had not been
explained to me and that wasn't fair&mdash;never! Teachers
and mothers were always telling good little girls not to play
with me, and I was <i>glad</i>! Girls the teachers call 'good'
sometimes are not that at all; they just know how to hide
things from the teachers." As her hearer made no comment,
but listened with an amused smile curving his lips,
Anna continued: "I <i>adore</i> books, but, oh, how I hate school,
when the rich girls laugh at my clothes and then at me if
I tell them that my mother is poor and we work for all we
have! It isn't fair, because we can't help it, and we do the
best we can. I never would say it to them in the world&mdash;never!
In the first school I went to they used to tease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the children who were timid, and bother them so much that
they would forget their lessons and get punished when it
was not their fault. But <i>I</i> looked after them," declared
Anna, proudly. "I fought their battles for them, until the
others left them alone, because they were afraid to fight me,
I was so strong. Oh, sir," she cried, "why can't people
always be fair and square, I wonder?"</p>

<p>As if mesmerized by the intensity of this remarkable
young reformer, the lawyer found himself repeating, "I
wonder!" as if he had no opinions on the subject, but at the
same time he was doing some thinking in regard to such a
unique character as this one before him. When she had
finished speaking he rose and put a bundle of work in her
hand. "I will help you and your brave mother all I can,"
he said. "While you are doing that copying I will speak to
other lawyers, who, I am sure, will give you more to do.
I have looked over what you have done, and can warmly
recommend you as a copyist. I hope we shall have many
more long talks together."</p>

<p>So with her package under her arm, and a warm feeling of
satisfaction in her heart because she had found a new friend
who said she could do good work, she hurried home.</p>

<p>Almost from baby days it had been evident that Anna
Dickinson was no ordinary child, and how to curb the restless
spirit and develop the strong nature into a fine woman
was a great problem for the already over-burdened mother.
Even as a young child Anna had an iron will, and discipline,
of which she later learned the value, so chafed her independent
nature that she was generally in a state of rebellion.
From her own story it was clear that she must have been a
terror to unjust teachers or pupils; but she did not mention
the many devoted friends she had gained by her championship
of those who were not being treated fairly according to
her ideas. Hers was a strong, talented, courageous, fearless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
nature, which was bound to be a great power for good or
evil. The scales were turned in the right direction by her
passionate love for her mother and an intense desire to lift
some of the burden of financial worry from her shoulders, as
she saw Mrs. Dickinson, with tireless industry, struggle to
make ends meet, and to feed, clothe, and educate her fatherless
children. Her one determination was to have them grow
up into noble men and women, but in Anna's early life it
seemed as if the tumultuous nature would never be brought
to any degree of poise and self-control. She showed a marked
love of books, even when she was only seven years old, and
would take one of her mother's volumes of Byron's poems
and, hiding under a bed, where she would not be disturbed,
read for hours.</p>

<p>When she was about twelve years old Anna went to the
"Westover Boarding-school of Friends," where she remained
for almost two years, and from which she went to the
"Friends' Select School" in Philadelphia, where she was
still studying when she applied for copying and found a new
friend. Both of the schools were free Quaker schools, as her
mother could not afford to send her elsewhere, and in both she
stood high for scholarship, if not for deportment. In the
latter institution she was noted for never failing in a recitation,
although she was taking twelve subjects at one time,
and was naturally looked upon with awe and admiration
by less brilliant pupils. A new scholar once questioned her
as to her routine of work, and the reply left her questioner
speechless with wonder.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't any," said Anna, with a toss of her curly
head. "And I don't study. I just go to bed and read,
sometimes till one o'clock in the morning&mdash;poetry, novels,
and all sorts of things; then just before I go to sleep I look
my lessons over." Evidently the new-comer was a bit
doubtful of being able to follow her leader, for Anna added,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
reassuringly: "Oh yes, you can, if you try. It's easy when
you get the habit!" and went off, leaving a much-amazed
girl behind her.</p>

<p>At the time of her visit to the lawyer's office Anna begged
to be allowed to leave school to try and add to the family
income, but her practical mother persuaded her not to do
this for at least a year or so, and, seeing the wisdom of the
advice, Anna remained in the "Friends' School." So
active was her mind that for weeks at a time she did not
sleep over five hours a night; the remaining time she spent
in doing all the copying she could get and in reading every
book on which she could lay her hands. Newspapers,
speeches, tracts, history, biography, poetry, novels and
fairy-tales&mdash;she devoured them all with eager interest. A
favorite afternoon pastime of hers was to go to the Anti-Slavery
Office, where, curled up in a cozy corner, she would
read their literature or listen to arguments on the subject
presented by persons who came and went. At other times
she would be seized with a perfect passion for a new book,
and would go out into the streets, determined not to return
home until she had earned enough to buy the coveted prize.
At such a time she would run errands or carry bundles or
bags for passengers coming from trains until she had enough
money for her book. Then she would hurry to a bookstore,
linger long and lovingly over the piles of volumes, and
finally buy one, which she would take home and devour,
then take it to a second-hand bookshop and sell it for a
fraction of what it cost, and get another.</p>

<p>Among her other delights were good lectures, and she
eagerly watched the papers to find out when George William
Curtis, Wendell Phillips, or Henry Ward Beecher was going
to lecture in the city; then she would start out on a campaign
to earn the price of a ticket for the lecture.</p>

<p>One day when she had read much about Wendell Phillips,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
but never heard him, she saw that he was to lecture in
Philadelphia on "The Lost Arts." It happened that there
was no copying for her to do at that time, and she had no
idea how to earn the twenty-five cents which would give her
the coveted admittance; but go to the lecture she must. As
she walked past a handsome residence she noticed that coal
had just been put in and the sidewalk left very grimy.
Boldly ringing the bell, she asked if she might scrub the walk,
and as a result of her exertion a triumphant young girl was
the first person to present herself at the hall that night, and
quite the most thrilled listener among the throng that
packed the house to hear Wendell Phillips. Although her
career was so soon to find her out, little did Anna dream on
that night, as she listened spellbound to the orator of the
occasion, that not far in the future many of that audience
were to be applauding a young girl with dark eyes, curly
hair, and such force of character and personal magnetism
that she was to sway her audiences even to a greater extent
than the man to whom she was listening.</p>

<p>When she was seventeen Anna left school for good, feeling
that she could not afford to give any more time to study
while her mother needed so many comforts and necessities
which money could buy. So she left the "Friends' Select
School," and in her unselfish reason for this, and the fact that
she was forced to support herself and others at such an early
age, when she longed for a more thorough education, lies an
appeal for kindly criticism of her work rather than a verdict
of superficiality, which some gave who did not understand or
appreciate the nature, the inspiration, or the real genius of
the young and enthusiastic girl.</p>

<p>She was offered a position as teacher in a school in New
Brighton, Beaver County, and accepting it she spent a few
months there, but as she did not like it she applied for a district-school
position that was vacant in the same town.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
When she had made all but the final arrangements with the
committee she asked, "What salary do you give?"</p>

<p>A committeeman replied: "A man has had the position
until now. We gave him twenty-eight dollars a month, but
we should not think of giving a <i>girl</i> more than sixteen."
Something in his manner and words stung Anna like a lash,
and, drawing herself up to her full height, she turned to
leave the room.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "though I am too poor to-day to buy a
pair of cotton gloves, I would rather go in rags than degrade
my womanhood by accepting anything at your hands!"
And off she went, to try her fate in some other place and way,
absolutely sure that in some unknown manner she was to
wrest success from the future. Young, inexperienced,
penniless, and with few friends, she passed weeks looking for
a situation in vain. At last she was offered work in a store,
but when she found that she must tell what was not true
about goods to customers rather than lose a sale, she put
on her hat and left at once, and again began her weary quest
of work. Everywhere she found that, if she had been a boy,
she could have secured better positions and pay than she
could as a girl. Also in her wide range of reading she discovered
that many of the advantages of life and all of the
opportunities, at that time, were given to men rather than
to women. Her independent nature was filled with determination
to do something to alter this, if she ever had a
chance. It came sooner than she would have dared to hope.</p>

<p>One Sunday she was sitting at home, reading a newspaper,
when she saw a notice of a meeting to be held that afternoon
in a certain hall by the "Association of Progressive Friends,"
to discuss "Woman's Rights and Wrongs." She would go.
Having decided this, she went to the home of a young friend
and persuaded her to go, too, and together they walked to
the hall and were soon deeply engrossed in the arguments
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
presented by the speakers. The presiding officer of the
afternoon was a Doctor Longshore, who announced before
the meeting began that at the close of the formal discussion
ladies were requested to speak, as the subject was one in
which they were especially interested.</p>

<p>"One after another, women rose and gave their views on the
question. Then, near the center of the house a girl arose
whose youthful face, black curls, and bright eyes, as well as
her musical voice and subdued but impressive manner, commanded
the attention of the audience. She spoke twice as
long as each speaker was allowed, and right to the point,
sending a thrill of interest through her listeners, who remembered
that speech for many a long day. At the close
of the meeting more than one in the audience came forward
and spoke to the beaming girl, thanking her for her brilliant
defense of her sex, and asking her to surely come to the
meeting on the following Sunday." Flushed with triumph
and excitement, she received the praise and congratulations
and promised to be present the next week. When the time
came she again rose and spoke in glowing language of the
rights and privileges which should be given to women as well
as to men. As soon as she sat down a tall, nervous man, with
an air of proud assurance that the world was made for his
sex, rose and spoke firmly against Anna's arguments, voicing
his belief that men were by right the lords and masters of
creation. While he spoke he fixed his eyes on Anna, as if
enchanted by the sight of her rapidly crimsoning cheeks and
flashing eyes, which showed emotions at white heat. The
moment he finished she stood again, and this time, young and
inexperienced though she was, with little education and less
knowledge of the great world, she held her audience spellbound
by the clear ideas which she poured out in almost
flawless English, and by her air of conviction which carried
belief in her arguments with it. She spoke clearly, steadily,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
as she summed up all the wrongs she had been obliged to
suffer through a struggling girlhood, as well as all she had
seen and read about and felt in her soul to be true, although
she had no tangible proofs. On flowed the tide of her oratory
in such an outburst of real feeling that her hearers were
electrified, amazed, by the rare magnetism of this young
and unknown girl. As she spoke she drew nearer to the man,
whose eyes refused now to meet her keen dark ones, and who
seemed deeply confused as she scored point after point in
defense, saying, "<i>You</i>, sir! said so and so," ... with each
statement sweeping away his arguments one by one until he
had no ground left to stand on. When her last word had
been said and she took her seat amid a storm of applause, he
swiftly and silently rose and left the hall, to the great amusement
of the audience, whose sympathies were entirely with
the young girl who had stated her case so brilliantly.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" was the question asked on every side as the
eager crowd pushed its way out of the building, all curious
to get a nearer view of the youthful speaker. Doctor
Longshore, who had opened the meeting, as on the previous
Sunday, was now determined to become acquainted with
Anna and find out what had gone into the making of such a
remarkable personality, and at the close of the meeting he
lost no time in introducing himself to her and making an
engagement to go to the Dickinson home to meet her family.</p>

<p>Before the time of his promised call&mdash;in fact, before Anna
had even mentioned her success as a speaker to her mother&mdash;while
she was out one day two gentlemen called at the house
and inquired if Miss Anna Dickinson lived there. Her
mother's cheeks paled with fright, for she feared Anna had
been doing some unconventional thing which the strangers
had come to report. When they said they had heard her
speak at a public meeting and were so much pleased with her
speech that they had come to find out something about her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
home surroundings, Mrs. Dickinson's brow cleared, and,
leading them into the house, she spent a pleasant half-hour
with them, and was secretly delighted with their comments
on her daughter's first appearance in public. When Anna
came home Mrs. Dickinson took her to task for not telling
her about such a great event, and was surprised to see the
real diffidence which the girl showed when she was questioned
about the meetings and her speeches. A few days later
Doctor Longshore called with her brother, Elwood, and with
their flattering assurances that her daughter was a born
speaker, and that she had already made some valuable
points on a vital subject, Mrs. Dickinson began to feel that
all her worry over Anna's turbulent childhood and restless
girlhood had not been in vain, that she was born to do great
things, and from that time she took a genuine pride in all the
achievements of the young girl who came so rapidly into
public notice.</p>

<p>The Longshores took Anna into their hearts and home at
once, and many of her happiest hours were spent with them.
"We felt toward her," Doctor Longshore said, "as if she
were our own child. We were the first strangers to show an
interest in her welfare and future plans, and she returned our
friendship with confidence and love." She was always so
buoyant, so full of vitality and gayety, that her visits were
eagerly anticipated, and for hours at a time she would entertain
her new friends with vivid and droll accounts of her
experiences at home and in school and of her attempts to
make money. And as she had won her way into the hearts
of her audience, at those first meetings, so now she kept the
Longshores enthralled, making them laugh at one moment
and cry at another. One night she had a horrible dream to
relate.</p>

<p>"I had been reading an account of the horrors of the slave
system at its worst," she said. "After going to bed, I was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
long in falling asleep. Finally I slept and dreamed that I
was a slave girl, and, oh, the agony of the knowledge! The
hot sun scorched my burning skin as I toiled in the fields,
with almost no clothing to soften the sun's heat. I was
hungry, but there was insufficient food. At last I was
dressed in clean, showy clothes and led to the auction-block,
where I was auctioned off to the highest bidder. He led me
away in triumph to even worse experiences, and when I
woke up I could not throw off the horror of the awful nightmare."</p>

<p>Seeing her tremble under the misery of the recollection,
Doctor Longshore soothed her by saying that the dream was
a natural result of the highly colored account she had been
reading before going to sleep, that all slaves were not by any
means treated in such a cruel manner, and at last she grew
calm. But whenever in future she spoke on the subject of
slavery this terrible memory would come back to her so
vividly that it would intensify her power to speak with conviction.</p>

<p>For several Sundays she went regularly to the "Progressive
Friends'" meeting and spoke with unvarying success.
Then she was invited to go to Mullica Hill, New Jersey,
to speak on the subject, "Woman's Work." After discussing
the matter with her mother and the Longshores, she
accepted the invitation and set herself to prepare the lecture
which she was to give. Then, on the first Sunday in
April, the seventeen-year-old orator went to her trial experience
as an invited speaker. By that time her praises had
been widely sung, and when she rose and saw her audience
there was a sea of upturned, eager faces looking into hers.
Speaking from the depths of her own experience, she held
the audience in breathless silence for over an hour. There
was, it was said, an indescribable pathos in her full, rich voice
that, aside from what she said, touched the hearts of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
hearers and moved many to tears, while all were spellbound,
and at the close of her address no one moved. Finally a man
rose and voiced the feeling of the people.</p>

<p>"We will not disperse until the speaker promises to address
us again this evening," he said, and a burst of applause
greeted his statement. A starry-eyed girl stood and bowed
her acknowledgment and agreed to speak again. As the
audience dispersed Anna heard some one say, "If Lucretia
Mott had made that speech it would be thought a great
one."</p>

<p>As she promised, in the evening she spoke again on slavery,
with equal success. A collection which was taken up for her
amounted to several dollars, the first financial result of what
was to be her golden resource.</p>

<p>But Anna had no thought of doing public speaking as her
only means of earning her living. She continued to look
for positions, but without success. Finally she took a district
school in Bucks County, at a monthly salary of twenty-five
dollars. So interested was she in the "Progressive
Friends'" Sunday meetings that she went home every second
week to attend them, and her speeches always won applause
from an audience that had learned to anticipate the impassioned
statements of the bright-eyed girl who was so much
younger and so much more intense than any other speaker.</p>

<p>And now she began to receive invitations to speak in other
places. On her eighteenth birthday she spoke in a small
village about thirty miles out of Philadelphia, when she
fairly electrified her hearers by the force of her arguments
and the form in which she presented them. She continued
to teach, although during her summer vacation she made
many speeches in New Jersey. On one occasion she spoke
in the open air, in a beautiful grove where hundreds had come
to hear "the girl orator" give her views on temperance and
slavery. Her earnestness and conviction of the truth of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
what she said made a profound impression, and even those
who later criticized her speech as being the product of an
immature and superficial mind were held as by a spell while she
spoke, and secretly admired her while they openly ridiculed
her arguments. At another time she was asked to speak at
the laying of the corner-stone of a new Methodist church.
The clergymen who gathered together were inclined to be
severe in their judgment of the remarks of a "slip of a girl."
Anna knew that and resolved to speak with more than usual
pathos and power. When she began her address amusement
was evident on the faces of the dignified men looking
at her. Gradually they grew more interested, the silence
became intense, and when the men rose to leave they were
subdued, and some of them even were not ashamed to be
seen wiping away tears. One of them introduced himself to
her and with a cordial hand-shake said: "Miss Dickinson, I
have always ridiculed Woman's Rights, but, so help me God,
I never shall again."</p>

<p>But this time the young orator could not help feeling the
power she had to sway great masses of people, and with a
thrill of joy she began to believe that perhaps in this work
which she loved above anything else in the world she would
some day find her vocation, for she was already receiving
commendation from men and women of a high order of
intelligence and being given larger contributions as a result
of her speeches.</p>

<p>The country was at that time in the beginning of its
Civil War period, and much was written and said on the
issue of the hour. At a Kennett Square meeting, where hot
debates were held on the burning question of the day, Anna
was one of the speakers, and one of the press notices on the
following day said:</p>

<p>"... The next speaker was Miss Anna Dickinson, of
Philadelphia, handsome, of an expressive countenance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
plainly dressed, and eloquent beyond her years. After the
listless, monotonous harangues of the previous part of the
day, the distinct, earnest tones of this juvenile Joan of Arc
were very sweet and charming. During her discourse,
which was frequently interrupted, Miss Dickinson maintained
her presence of mind, and uttered her radical sentiments
with resolution and plainness. Those who did not
sympathize with her remarks were softened by her simplicity
and solemnity. Her speech was decidedly the speech of the
evening.... Miss Dickinson, we understand, is a member
of the Society of Friends, and her speech came in the shape of
a retort to remarks which were contrary to her own beliefs.
With her usual clear-cut conviction and glowing oratory,
Miss Dickinson said that:</p>

<p>"'We are told to maintain constitutions because they are
constitutions, and compromises because they are compromises.
But what are compromises?' asked the young
speaker, 'and what was laid down in these constitutions?
Eminent lawgivers have said that certain great fundamental
ideas of right are common to the world, and that all laws
of man's making which trample on those ideas are null and
void&mdash;wrong to obey, but right to disobey. The Constitution
of the United States sat upon the neck of those rights,
recognizes human slavery, and makes the souls of men
articles of purchase and sale.'"</p>

<p>So clear of mind and expression was the young orator that
her statements sank as deeply into the minds of her hearers
as if spoken by a far more learned person, and from that time
her intense nature had found its true outlet, and her longing
to provide her mother with some of the comforts which had
so long been denied her was soon to be realized.</p>

<p>In that same year of her speech at Kennett Square, on an
evening in late February, she spoke in Concert Hall, Philadelphia,
before an audience of about eight hundred persons.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
For two hours she spoke, without notes and with easy
fluency. There were many well-known men and women
there, who were delighted with what they were pleased to
call a young girl's notable performance. But Anna herself
was far from pleased with her speech. Afterward, on
reaching the Longshores', she threw herself into a chair with
an air of utter despondency, and, in response to their praise,
only shook her head.</p>

<p>"I am mortified," she declared. "I spoke too long, and
what I said lacked arrangement, order, and point. And
before such an audience!"</p>

<p>This incident shows clearly that, despite all the flattery
which was showered on her at that time, she did not lose her
sense of balance, but knew with a keen instinct whether she
had achieved her end or not.</p>

<p>And now winter was over and spring had come with its
spirit of new birth and fulfilment. And, as the buds began
to swell and open, the strong will and fresh young spirit of
Anna Dickinson asserted itself in a desire for more profitable
daily work, for as yet she was not able to give up other
employment for the public speaking which brought her in
uneven returns. She disliked the confinement and routine
of teaching so much that she decided to try a new kind of
work, and secured a place in the Mint, where she described
her duties vividly to her interested friends.</p>

<p>"I sat on a stool," she said, "from seven o'clock in the
morning to six at night for twenty-eight dollars a month.
The atmosphere of the room was close and impure, as it was
necessary to keep all windows and doors closed in the adjusting-room,
for the least draught of air would vary the scales."
Not a very congenial occupation for the independent nature
of the young orator, but, although she disliked the work, she
was very skilful at it, and soon became the fastest adjuster
in the Mint. But she could not bear the confinement of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
adjusting-room and changed to the coining-room, yet even
that was impossible to a spirit which had seen a vision of
creative work and of ability to do it. Then, too, she thoroughly
disliked the men with whom she was thrown and their
beliefs, knowing them to be opposed to principles which
she held sacred; so when, in November, she made a speech on
the events of the war, in which she stated her views so frankly
that when they came to the ears of Government officials who
did not agree with her she was dismissed from the Mint,
she was rather pleased than troubled.</p>

<p>Through the remainder of the winter she continued to
speak in various suburbs of the city, not always to sympathetic
audiences, for so radical were some of her assertions,
especially coming from the lips of a mere girl, that she was
hissed time and again for her assertions. Despite this, she
was becoming well known as a speaker of great ability, and
as the war went on, with its varying successes for the North
and South, she thought with less intensity on the subjects of
the future of the negro and the wrongs of women, and became
more deeply absorbed in questions of national importance,
which was a fortunate thing for her. She was enthusiastic,
eloquent, young and pretty, all of which characteristics
made her a valuable ally for any cause. Mr. Garrison, the
noted Abolitionist, heard her speak twice, and was so
delighted with her manner and ability that he asked for an
introduction to her, and invited her to visit Boston and make
his house her home while there. She thanked him with
pretty enthusiasm and accepted, but before going to Boston
was persuaded to give the lecture in Philadelphia, for which
she had been dismissed from the Mint. A ten-cent admission
was charged, and Judge Pierce, one of the early advocates of
Woman's Rights, presided and introduced the young
speaker. The house was crowded, and this time she was
satisfied with her lecture, while the eager Longshores and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
her mother were filled with a just pride. After all expenses
were paid she was handed a check for a bigger sum of money
than she had ever owned before. The largest share of it was
given at once to her mother, then, after a serious discussion
with Doctor Longshore, Anna decided to spend the remainder
on her first silk dress. Despite oratory and advanced
views, the girl of eighteen was still human and feminine, and
it is to be doubted whether any results of her labors ever gave
her more satisfaction than that bit of finery for her public
appearances.</p>

<p>And now the young orator went to Boston, where through
Mr. Garrison's influence she was invited to speak in Theodore
Parker's pulpit, as leading reformers were then doing. She
also spoke in the Music Hall on "The National Crisis," and
that lecture was the hardest trial she ever experienced. For
two days before it she could not sleep or eat, and answered
questions like one in a dream, and Mr. Garrison and those
friends who had been confident of her ability to hold any
audience began to feel extremely nervous. If she should
make a failure now at the beginning of her career, it would
be critical for her future.</p>

<p>The night came, and with ill-concealed nervousness Anna
put on the new silk dress, shook her heavy curls into place,
and with resolute courage went to the hall, where, on
mounting the platform, she noted the most tremendous
audience she had ever before faced. Mr. Garrison opened
the meeting by reading a chapter of the Bible, then he used
up as much time as possible in remarks, in order to make the
best of a bad situation, for he felt that she was not in a state
of mind or body to hold the coldly critical audience before
her. While he read and spoke poor Anna behind him waited
to be presented, in an agony of nervousness which she struggled
not to show. Then came the singing of the "Negro
Boatman's Song of Whittier" by a quartet, accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
by the organ. At last, with an easy smile, which concealed
his real feelings, Mr. Garrison turned to introduce Anna, and
she rose and walked forward to the front of the platform,
looking more immature and girlish than ever before. Her
first sentences were halting, disconnected, her fingers twined
and twisted nervously around the handkerchief she held;
then she saw a sympathetic upturned face in the front row
of the audience staring up at her. Something in the face
roused Anna to a determined effort. Throwing herself into
her subject, she soon was pouring out a passionate appeal
for a broader national life and action. Gone were fear and
self-consciousness, gone all but determination to make her
audience feel as she felt, believe as she believed, in the interest
of humanity and the highest ideals. For over an hour
she held that coldly critical mass of New England hearers as
if by a magic spell, then the vast audience rose and gave vent
to their emotion by the singing of "America," and then
persons of distinction and wealth crowded around the speaker
of the evening with thanks and praise. To one and all the
young orator, whose eyes were still shining with enthusiasm,
replied, simply: "I thank you. The subject is very near
my heart," and as those who met her turned away they could
not hide their amazement at the ability of a young person
who looked so immature in her girlish beauty and freshness.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a period of success. She delivered
the Boston lecture in several other New England
cities, and had many fine press notices on it, one of which
closed with the following sentences:</p>

<p>"Her whole appearance and manner were decidedly attractive,
earnest, and expressive. Her lecture was well
arranged, logical, and occasionally eloquent, persuasive, and
pathetic."</p>

<p>That was the time when every woman with a tender heart
and a chance to show it for the benefit of the wounded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
soldiers served her apprenticeship in some hospital, and Anna
was one of them. With keen sympathy she nursed and comforted
the sick men, who told her freely about their hardships
and sufferings, as well as the motives which led them
to go into the army, and she learned their opinion of war
and of life on the battle-fields. From this experience she
gained much priceless material which she later used most
successfully.</p>

<p>She was now beginning to be known as much for her youth
and personal charm as for the subject-matter of her lectures,
and to her unbounded joy in October, 1862, she received one
hundred dollars and many flattering press notices for a
speech given before the Boston Fraternity Lyceum. This
success encouraged her to plan a series of lectures to be given
in various parts of the East, especially in New England,
from which she hoped to gain substantial results. But in
making her plans she had failed to reckon with the humor
of the people who under the stress of war had little interest
even in the most thrilling lectures, and she traveled from
place to place with such meager returns that she became
perfectly disheartened, and, worse than that, she was almost
penniless.</p>

<p>When she had filled her last engagement of the series, for
which she was to receive the large sum of ten dollars, at
Concord, New Hampshire, she realized with a sinking heart
that unless she could turn the tide of her affairs quickly she
must again seek another occupation. The resolute girl was
almost disheartened, and she confessed to a friend later:</p>

<p>"No one knows how I felt and suffered that winter, penniless
and alone, with a scanty wardrobe, suffering with cold,
weariness, and disappointment. I wandered about on the
trains day after day among strangers, seeking employment
for an honest living and failing to find it. I would have gone
home, but had not the means. I had borrowed money to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
commence my journey, promising to remit soon; failing to do
so, I could not ask again. Beyond my Concord meeting, all
was darkness. I had no further plans."</p>

<p>With positive want staring her in the face, in debt for the
trip which she had taken on a venture, and shrinkingly sensitive
in regard to her inability to aid her mother more
lavishly, there was need of quick action. Alone in a boarding-house
room, Anna reviewed her resources and the material
she had on hand for a new and more taking lecture.</p>

<p>"I have it!" she exclaimed, jumping to her feet, and taking
up a pad and pencil she hastily began to write a lecture in
which she used the material gained in her hospital experience.
She called it "Hospital Life." When she gave it on
that night at Concord with a heavy heart it proved to be the
pivot on which her success as a lecturer swung to its greatest
height. As she drew her vivid pictures of the hospital
experience and horrors of war and slavery she melted her
audience to tears by her impassioned delivery. The secretary
of the New Hampshire Central Committee was in the
audience and was enchanted as he heard the young speaker
for the first time. At the close of the lecture he said to a
friend:</p>

<p>"If we can get this girl to make that speech all through
New Hampshire, we can carry the Republican ticket in this
State in the coming election."</p>

<p>So impressed was he with Anna's powers of persuasion that
he decided to invite her to become a campaign speaker on his
own responsibility, if the State Committee did not think
well of the idea. But that committee was only too glad to
adopt any plan to aid their cause. Anna Dickinson, then
only eighteen years old, was invited to become part of the
State machinery, to work on the side which appealed to her
sense of justice. Elated, excited, and enthusiastic, she accepted
the offer and began to speak early in March. What a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
work that was for the young and inexperienced girl! In the
month before election, twenty times she stood before great
throngs of eager persons and spoke, rousing great enthusiasm
by her eloquent appeals in the name of reason and fair
play.</p>

<p>Slight, pretty, and without any of the tricks of the professional
political speaker, her march through the State was a
succession of triumphs which ended in a Republican victory,
and, though many of her enemies called her "ignorant and
illogical" as well as "noisy" in mind and spirit, the adverse
criticism was of no consequence in comparison to the praise
and success which far outweighed it.</p>

<p>The member in the first district, having no faith that a
woman could influence politics, sent word to the secretary,
"Don't send that woman down here to defeat my election."</p>

<p>The secretary replied, "We have work enough for her to
do in other districts without interfering with you!"</p>

<p>When the honorable member saw the furore Anna was
creating he changed his mind and begged the secretary to let
her speak in his district. The secretary replied: "It is too
late; the program is arranged.... You would not have
her when you could, now you cannot have her when you
will!"</p>

<p>That district was lost by a large majority, while the others
went strongly Republican, and it is interesting to note that
when the good news reached headquarters the Governor-elect
himself personally sent Anna thanks for her eloquent
speeches, and to her amazement she was serenaded, feasted,
and praised in a way that would have turned the head of a
young woman who had been more interested in her own success
than in victory for a cause for which she stood. But
that and the money she could make and pass on to her
mother were Anna's supreme objects in whatever she undertook,
and although she would have been less than human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
if the praise and recognition had not pleased her, yet her
real joy lay in the good-sized checks which she could now
add to the family treasury.</p>

<p>"Having done such good work in the New Hampshire
election, her next field of endeavor was Connecticut, where
the Republicans were completely disheartened, for nothing,
they said, could prevent the Democrats from carrying the
State. The issue was a vital one, and yet so discouraged
were the Connecticut politicians that they were about to
give up the fight without further effort, when it was decided
to try having the successful young girl speaker see what she
could do for them. Anna was only too delighted to accept
the challenge, and at once started on a round of stump-speaking
and speechmaking, with all the enthusiasm of her intense
nature added to the inspiration of her recent success in a
neighboring State. The results were almost miraculous.
Two weeks of steady work not only turned the tide of popular
feeling, but created a perfect frenzy of interest in the young
orator. Even the Democrats, in spite of scurrilous attacks
made on her by some of their leaders, received her everywhere
with the warmest welcome, tore off their party badges,
and replaced them by her picture, while giving wild applause
to all she said. The halls where she spoke were so densely
packed that the Republicans stayed away to make room for
the Democrats, and the women were shut out to leave room
for those who could vote."</p>

<p>Well had her mother's struggle to make a fine woman of
her turbulent daughter been repaid. Never was there such
a furore over any orator in the history of this country. The
critical time of her appearance, the excited condition of the
people, her youth, beauty, and remarkable voice, all heightened
the effect of her genius. Her name was on every lip.
Ministers preached about her, prayed for her as a second
Joan of Arc raised up by God to save their State for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
loyal party, and through it the nation to freedom and humanity.
And through all the excitement and furore the
youthful heroine moved with calm poise and a firm determination
toward her goal, attempting to speak clearly and
truthfully in regard to what were her sacred beliefs.</p>

<p>Election Day was at hand, and missionary work must not
slacken even for one moment. On the Saturday night before
the fateful day Anna spoke before an audience of over
one thousand of the working-men of Hartford, Connecticut.
This was the last effort of the campaign, and it was a remarkable
tribute to a young woman's powers that the committee
of men were willing to rest their case on her efforts.
A newspaper account of the meeting said:</p>

<p>"Allyn Hall was packed as it never was before. The
aisles were full of men who stood patiently for more than
three hours; the window-sills had their occupants, every
foot of standing room was taken, and in the rear of the galleries
men seemed to hang in swarms like bees. Such was
the view from the stage.... To such an audience Miss
Dickinson spoke for two hours and twenty minutes, and
hardly a listener left the hall during that time. Her power
over the audience was marvelous. She seemed to have that
absolute mastery of it which Joan of Arc is reported to have
had over the French troops. They followed her with that
deep attention which is unwilling to lose a word, but greeted
her, every few moments, with the most wild applause....
The speech in itself and its effect was magnificent&mdash;this
strong adjective is the proper one.... The work of the
campaign is done. It only remains in the name, we are sure,
of all loyal men in this district to express to Miss Dickinson
heartfelt thanks for her splendid, inspiring aid. She has
aroused everywhere respect, enthusiasm and devotion, let
us not say to herself alone, but to the country; while such
women are possible in the United States, there isn't a spot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
big enough for her to stand on that won't be fought for so
long as there is a man left."</p>

<p>Even that achievement was not the height of the young
orator's attainment. Her next ovation was at Cooper
Institute in New York City, where she spoke in May of the
same year. Faded newspaper accounts of that meeting
fill us with amazement that such a triumph could be, with
only a girl's indomitable will, an insufficient education and
much reading of books back of it.</p>

<p>"Long before the appointed hour for the lecture the hall
was crowded. The people outside were determined to get
in at all hazards, ushers were beaten down, those with tickets
rushed in, and those without tickets were pushed aside, while
thousands went home unable to get standing room even in
the lobbies and outer halls.</p>

<p>"On the platform sat some of the most distinguished men
of the day: clergymen, lawyers, generals, admirals, leaders
of the fashionable set&mdash;all eager to do homage to the simple
girl of whom the press said:</p>

<p>"'She is medium in height, slight in form, graceful in
movement, her head, well poised, adorned with heavy dark
hair, displaying to advantage a pleasant face which has all
the signs of nervous force and of vigorous mental life. In
manner she is unembarrassed, without a shade of boldness;
her gestures are simple, her voice is of wonderful power,
penetrating rather than loud, as clear as the tone of metal,
and yet with a reed-like softness. Her vocabulary is simple,
and in no instance has there been seen a straining after
effective expressions; yet her skill in using ordinary language
is so great that with a single phrase she presents a
picture and delivers a poem in a sentence.'"</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting, which had been opened by
Henry Ward Beecher, he rose and said, with real emotion,
"Let no man open his lips here to-night; music is the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
fitting accompaniment to the eloquent utterances we have
heard." Then the famous Hutchinson family sang and
closed the meeting with the John Brown song, in which the
vast audience joined with thrilling effect.</p>

<p>From that Cooper Institute meeting Anna received almost
one thousand dollars, an incredible amount for a
simple speech to her unmercenary spirit, but one which
was to be duplicated many times before her career was
over.</p>

<p>After that meeting in New York her reputation as a public
speaker was established, despite the carping critics, and she
continued to win fresh laurels, not only for herself, but for
vital issues. When doing more campaigning in Pennsylvania
she had to travel through the mining districts, where
her frank words were often ridiculed and she was pelted
with stones, rotten eggs, and other unpleasant missiles.
But she bore it all like a warrior, and made a remarkable
record for speeches in parts of the State where no man
dared to go. Despite this and the fact that the victorious
party owed its success largely to the young orator,
the committee never paid her one cent for her services&mdash;to
their great discredit, probably having spent all their
campaign funds in some other less legitimate way and
thinking they could more easily defraud a girl than a more
shrewd man.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, she continued to speak wherever she
could get a hearing, and at last came an invitation to make
an address in Washington, D. C. Here indeed was a triumph!
She hesitated long before accepting the invitation,
for it would be a trying ordeal, as among her audience would
be the President and many diplomats and high government
officials. But with sturdy courage she accepted, and as a
result faced, as she later said, the most brilliant audience
ever assembled to hear her speak. It was a unique sensation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
for the dignitaries and men of mark to sit as listeners at
the feet of this slender girl, who was speaking on profound
questions of the day; but she made a deep impression, even
on those who did not agree with her opinions, and it was a
proud moment of her life when at the close of the meeting she
met the President and his Cabinet. The Chief Executive
gladly granted her an interview for the following day,
and like other men of lesser rank, was carried out of himself
as he watched the play of expression, the light and shade on
her mobile face, as they talked together of the vital topics
of the day.</p>

<p>Anna Dickinson was now an orator beyond a doubt; in
fact, the only <i>girl</i> orator the country had ever known. More
than that, she made use of her eloquence, her magnetism,
her flow of language, not for any minor use, but in presenting
to the public the great problems of her day and in pleading
for honor and justice, freedom and fullness of joy for the
individual, with such intensity of purpose as few men have
ever used in pleading a cause.</p>

<p>That she wrote and acted in a play dealing with one of the
subjects nearest her heart, and that she published a novel of
the same kind, added nothing to her fame. She was wholly
an orator with an instinctive knowledge of the way to play
on the emotions of her listeners. Her faults were the faults
of an intense nature too early obliged to grapple with hard
problems; her virtues were those of a strong, independent,
unselfish nature. It has been said that she rose to fame on
the crest of three waves: the negro wave, the war wave, and
the woman wave. If that is so, then was her success as a
public speaker something of which to be proud, for to have
spoken on such subjects surely betokens a great nature.
Anna Dickinson has been called the "Joan of Arc" of her day
and country. If she had not the delicate spiritual vision of
the Maid of France, she had her superb courage in reaching
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
up toward an ideal. What she was and what she accomplished
as an American girl, who was an orator at eighteen,
gives an incentive and a new enthusiasm to young Americans
of the twentieth century, for what girls have done girls can
do, and we believe, with that greatest of poets, that "the
best is yet to be."</p>

Printer errors (omitted punctuation, omitted or transposed letters,

Page 128 had an obscured section of text, which reads "... then the

with the space and few visible marks, the missing text would seem to
be "be rowed" so those words have been used.<br />
<br />
Page 258 contains a quotation which includes the term "scrape-goat"
which would appear to be a deliberate spelling on the part of the
